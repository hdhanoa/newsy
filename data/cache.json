            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 16.01 EDT Two things are certain in life: death and the internet. With so many day-to-day functions, tasks and memories now taking place online, the question of what will become of your digital legacy  who will preserve, control or delete your accounts when you are gone  has become increasingly important. Making a plan now can prevent identity theft, preserve documents and records you want saved, and stop your friends and family receiving painful pop-up reminders on social media. But from privacy issues and cybersecurity to copyright, there are many potential hurdles to organising your digital will. Heres what you need to know. Dr Emily van der Nagel from Monash University says that people should spend some time planning for how their online accounts and identities will be managed after they die. At a basic level, she says people should think of it like backing up their data. If there are things you want to preserve  for your family, friends or for your own records  its best to download a version so that you wont have to rely on third-party companies. That could be favourite photos, tweets, blog posts, videos or songs youve uploaded. A lot of platforms, including Twitter, Facebook and in some cases YouTube, offer really good tools for you to download everything that has been part of that platform, she says. That is really good practice to do, semi-regularly, say when you are updating your passwords. It is worth thinking about how you may want to save this digital content for people who might want to access it after your death. It might be good practice to curate a little bit, set up a folder. The reason for doing so is that once you are gone, your family, friends or an executor may find it harder to access your data than they anticipated. A lot of platforms have terms of service agreements that prevent other people from logging in to your account, she says. Of course that is a privacy thing, especially things like email accounts or social media accounts that include direct messaging. Those messages are considered private for good reason. On sites like Facebook, there are options to have people designated as legacy contacts who can manage your account after you die. Your executor can then decide whether to leave your account active, delete it, or memorialise it  which can stop it showing up in feeds in insensitive ways. The danger is if you dont do anything, it can impact on the algorithm in an upsetting or unsettling kind of way, van der Nagel says. You can get them turning up as people you may know, or nudged about a happy memory that happened a year ago. Another way to manage a digital legacy is to create a secure document (either a physical sealed item, a hard drive, or a password-protected cloud drive) that has your accounts, usernames and passwords. Though, van der Nagel warns, you should take all the necessary privacy precautions and only give it to people you trust. Its really important that people are aware that these services exist, she says. There are steps you can take before it happens, you dont want to have to deal with this suddenly and unexpectedly while you are grieving. It depends on which platform, but there are ways people can access the accounts of a deceased person, van der Nagel says. With Microsoft, which runs Outlook, you can request access to some information in that account and close it. There is an email address set up specifically for that  the Microsoft custodian of records. Van der Nagel says that this is similar to letting banks or billing companies know that a person has died, and usually relies on showing a company a death certificate. But, due to privacy concerns, she says people should be aware they may not gain full access to an account. Through email, you can turn off some services, and gain some information. For example if your mother has died you can turn off some services  but you cant necessarily read every email that she sent. Van der Nagael says that in Victoria, a person can create a digital register through the state trustee. This is quite an involved process that goes alongside the legal making of a will, but if done right, you can include all your account logins and information. You can create a digital register, it doesnt go in your will, it goes alongside your will. You can basically give all the keys to your lawyer. Now that would be a really daunting option for someone to set up in their 20s, who does not yet own property. In that case, maybe it would be the most practical option to save it in a hard drive and give it to your dad. The answer is, broadly, yes. Van der Nagel says that most terms of service for these social media accounts set up licences and rights between an individual person (ie you) and the companies. For example, it is very possible that a video that you make and put on Youtube does not necessarily go to your family after your death. This is more complicated that simply owning a photograph or owning a CD, she says. Physical property you are legally allowed to bequeath. Digital property is not that easy in some cases. And sites like Instagram usually reserve the right to use your photos to advertise the platform  and this could technically continue after you die. You can in some cases, van der Nagel says. It is always easier to do when you have a death certificate. It is an important legal document. On Google there is an inactive account manager, so you can set up and add trusted contacts who can go in and shut down your account. For Microsoft you can contact the Microsoft custodian of records. Usually you can show the death certificate, show yourself as the executor and put into place the processes they have put in place. This will usually mean shutting down the account rather than gaining access to the account. But she adds: It is much easier with Facebook to memorialise accounts than to delete them. It is not hard to say that Facebook still wants your data after you are dead. These platforms dont want to let go of somebodys account and all the info they have given the platform."

            "content": "A second lieutenant in the US army is suing two Virginia police officers over a traffic stop last December in which the officers drew their guns, pointed them at him and used a slang term to suggest he was facing execution before pepper-spraying him and knocking him to the ground. Body camera footage shows Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino, dressed in uniform and with his hands held in the air outside the drivers window as he tells the armed officers he is honestly afraid to get out of his SUV. Yeah, you should be! one officer responds during the stop at a gas station. In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Nazario says his rights were violated during the stop in the town of Windsor. The two sides dispute what happened after a second police officer joined the first one. Nazario was coming from his duty station and going home, his attorney Jonathan Arthur said. Graduated from Virginia State University, Arthur said. He was commissioned out of their ROTC program. Hes an officer in the United States armed forces. These guys decide to do this to him. Asked about Nazarios condition, Arthur said: Hes definitely not doing too well. Daniel Crocker, a Windsor police officer, radioed that he was attempting to stop a vehicle with no rear license plate and tinted windows. He said the driver was eluding police and he considered it a high-risk traffic stop, according to a report included in the court filing. Arthur said Nazario explained he wasnt trying to elude the officer but was trying to stop in a well-lit area for officer safety and out of respect for the officers. Another officer, Joe Gutierrez, was driving by when he heard Crockers call, saw him attempting to stop the SUV and decided to join the stop. Gutierrez acknowledged that Nazarios decision to drive to a lighted area happens to him a lot, and 80% of the time, its a minority, Arthur said, quoting the officer. The lawsuit says that by the time the two officers reached Nazarios SUV, the license plate was visible in the rear. Nazario drove to a gas station where, according to the lawsuit, the officers drew their guns and pointed them at Nazario. The officers attempted to pull Nazario out of his vehicle while he continued to keep his hands in the air. Gutierrez pepper-sprayed Nazario multiple times. I dont even want to reach for my seatbelt, can you please ... My hands are out, can you please  look, this is really messed up, Nazario stammered, his eyes shut. The officers shouted conflicting orders, telling him to put his hands out the window while telling him to open the door and get out, the lawsuit says. At one point, Gutierrez told Nazario he was fixin to ride the lightning, a reference to the electric chair and a line from The Green Mile, a film about a Black man facing execution. Nazario got out of the vehicle and asked for a supervisor. Gutierrez responded with knee-strikes, knocking him to the ground, the lawsuit says. The two officers struck Nazario multiple times, then handcuffed and interrogated him. The stop was captured on Nazarios cellphone and cameras worn by Crocker and Gutierrez, according to the lawsuit. These cameras captured footage of behavior consistent with a disgusting nationwide trend of law enforcement officers who, believing they can operate with complete impunity, engage in unprofessional, discourteous, racially biased, dangerous and sometimes deadly abuses of authority, the lawsuit says. The Windsor police did not immediately comment. No one answered the phone at a number listed for Crocker. He and Gutierrez still work for the department, the town manager told the Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk. Windsor is about 70 miles south-east of Richmond, the state capital."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 15.41 EDT The Republican governor of Georgia stepped up his attack on Major League Baseball on Saturday, over its decision to pull its All-Star Game from the state in response to a new voting law. Its minority-owned businesses that have been hit harder than most because of an invisible virus, by no fault of their own, Brian Kemp said. And these are the same minority businesses that are now being impacted by another decision that is by no fault of their own. The Fox News host Sean Hannity thundered this week that MLB has now cost the people of Georgia almost $100m in revenue. Every person in Georgia should be furious, he added. But experts dispute that losing the All-Star game will have so heavy an impact. Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross, told the Guardian this week: There is some loss, so its not zero, but its a whole lot closer to zero than the $100m number Atlanta was throwing around. On Saturday Kemp spoke alongside the Georgia attorney general, Chris Carr, also a Republican, at a seafood restaurant miles from the stadium in the Atlanta suburbs where the game would have been held. He said he didnt think the business was minority-owned. The game will now be played in Denver. Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, has claimed the city will receive an economic boost of $190m. Matheson said: Theres no real reason that you should believe economic impact numbers that are commissioned by people who are made to look good by big economic impact numbers. Kemp noted that Denver has a much smaller percentage of African Americans than Atlanta. Critics say the Georgia voting law will disproportionately affect communities of color. Aklima Khondoker, state director of the voting rights group All Voting is Local, said Kemps news conference was an attempt to deflect from that as he gears up to try to win a second term. Hes pivoting away from all of the malicious things that we understand that this bill represents to people of color in Georgia, she said. Elsewhere in the state, about two dozen protesters turned out near Augusta National as the Masters golf championship continued, holding signs that said Let Us Vote and Protect Georgia Voting Rights. The MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred, has said he made the decision to move the All-Star game after discussions with players and the Players Alliance, an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year, and that the league opposed restrictions to the ballot box. On Saturday an MLB spokesman said the league had no immediate additional comment. Several groups have filed lawsuits over the Georgia voting measure, which includes strict identification requirements for voting by mail. It expands weekend early voting but limits the use of ballot drop boxes, makes it a crime to hand out food or water to voters waiting in line and gives the state election board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to replace local officials. That has led to concerns the Republican-controlled board could exert more influence over elections, including the certification of county results. The rewrite of Georgias election rules  signed by Kemp last month  follows Donald Trumps repeated lies about electoral fraud after his loss to Joe Biden. The Democratic candidate won Georgia, before two Democrats won Senate runoffs there in January, tipping control of the chamber. Democrats have assailed the Georgia law as an attempt to suppress Black and Latino votes, with Biden calling it Jim Crow in the 21st century. Carr and Kemp blasted that comparison. This made-up narrative that this bill takes us back to Jim Crow  an era when human beings were being killed and who were truly prevented from casting their vote  is preposterous, Carr said. It is irresponsible, and its fundamentally wrong."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 11.58 EDT The trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer charged with murdering George Floyd in Minneapolis last May, completed its 10th day of witness testimony on Friday. The second week was very different from the first but no less dramatic. The opening days of prosecution witness testimony last week focused on viral, harrowing bystander video and newly released footage of Floyds agonizing death, then on the accounts of some traumatized bystanders. In the second week, two key witnesses formed striking bookends. The Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, testified against Chauvin on Monday. On Friday Andrew Baker, who performed the autopsy, took the stand. He classified the death as a homicide, which he said in a medical context meant that it resulted from the actions of a person or persons but did not imply any criminal action. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died after Chauvin, 45, kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes. The killing galvanised the Black Lives Matter movement and triggered the biggest civil rights protests since the 1960s in a reckoning on police brutality and entrenched racism. Chauvin denies all charges. Arradondo, the first Black police chief in Minneapolis , told the jury he vehemently disagreed that there had been any justification for Chauvin to restrain Floyd the way he had. Chauvin (who was fired the day after Floyds death) breached regulations, in no way, shape or form followed training and showed a disregard for police principles to respect the sanctity of life, the chief said. Arradondo was the biggest name in a succession of serving officers who testified against Chauvin, their former colleague of 19 years. The civil rights lawyer David Henderson told MSNBC he had never seen multiple police officers cross the blue line and testify against one of their own, as the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder related it. He added: I think George Floyd is going to continue to transform the world  Theres going to be a clear line drawn between how these cases are tried prior to George Floyds death  and after. But at the same time, he said, police problems are systemic. The CNN commentator Van Jones described Arradondos transparent approach as what we want from modern policing  This is the professionalism people have been begging for for 20 to 30 years. Martin Tobin, a pulmonary and critical care specialist for 40 years, told the jury on Thursday Floyd had been caught in a vice between Chauvin and the street. Mr Floyd died from a low level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain, he said, adding that in turn caused Floyds heart to stop. Tobin said: A healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died. The forensic pathologist Lindsey Thomas testified: The activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyds death. The defense lawyer Eric Nelson wants to show that Floyd died of heart problems combined with drug use. Thomas agreed that Floyds underlying heart condition was a potential cause of death. The week concluded with testimony from Baker, the Hennepin county chief medical examiner whom Thomas helped to train. He stopped short of backing expert witnesses who testified that Floyd was asphyxiated by Chauvins knee. Baker told the court the officer pinning the man to the ground was just more than Mr Floyd could take by making it hard for him to breathe, causing stress hormones that worsened a heart condition and led to his death. It was a subtle point, but the defense will look to exploit any sense of doubt. The trial continues."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 12.07 EDT There are ominous signs of a new wave of coronavirus infections building in the US midwest, even as vaccinations continue to gather pace across the country. In Michigan, hospitalisations have soared and intensive care beds are being rapidly filled. An average of 7,226 cases a day were confirmed in the state last week, according to Johns Hopkins University data, approaching record highs seen in November. Michigans public health system is overwhelmed, warned the states top medical official, Joneigh Khaldun. The surge has prompted Governor Gretchen Whitmer to urge people to restrict activities and wear masks and for schools to halt in-person learning. A year in, we all know what works and this has to be a team effort, the Democrat said. We have to do this together. Lives depend on it. Covid is also making a resurgence, albeit to a lesser degree, in Minnesota, where cases have jumped since March. On Friday, 2,659 new infections were reported, the most in a single day since January. Governor Tim Walz has said he is not planning new restrictions but called on the federal government to speed up vaccine delivery. Illinois reported 4,004 new cases on Friday, also the most since January, with the number of seriously sick people in hospital rising. We are seeing hospitalisations going up. Its very challenging, said the governor, JB Pritzker. I watch the numbers every day and Im hypersensitive to what direction the state is going and what we need to do next. Public health experts have blamed the rise in cases on on the spread of the highly infectious coronavirus variant B117, first identified in the UK, along with the relaxation of restrictions in the wake of dropping cases and the uptake of vaccines. The variant is now the most common source of new infections in the US, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The agency is attempting to track the spread of the variant to help states clamp down on its spread. The fresh wave of cases has clouded optimism spurred by speedy vaccine rollout. The CDC has said one in four of all adults are now fully vaccinated, with 75% of older people getting at least one dose. Its almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase, Anthony Fauci, Joe Bidens top medical adviser, told CNN. Fauci said people needed to hang in there a bit longer. Now is not the time, as Ive said so many times, to declare victory prematurely."

The blast from 2012 caused a cataract, excessive tissue damage, and extensive damage to my retina, Crenshaw said in a statement. It was always a possibility that the effects of the damage to my retina would resurface, and it appears that is exactly what has happened. Crenshaw said the retina to his left eye was found to be detaching after he went to an ophthalmologist because of dark, blurry vision, and that he underwent surgery on Friday. The surgery went well, but I will be effectively blind for about a month, according to Crenshaw. Crenshaw, a staunch conservative who has stoked controversy on the national stage, was re-elected in November representing Texas 2nd district, in the Houston area."

            "content": "A previously undisclosed document prepared by the Pentagon for internal use reveals dramatic new details about how authorities sought to quell the attack on the Capitol on 6 January and re-establish order  and how such help took agonising hours in coming. Two hours after the Capitol was breached, as supporters of Donald Trump pummelled police and vandalised the building, Vice-President Mike Pence tried to assert control. In an urgent phone call to the acting defense secretary, he issued a startling demand. Clear the Capitol, Pence said. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, were making a similarly desperate appeal, asking the army to deploy the national guard. We need help, Schumer said, more than an hour after the Senate chamber had been breached. At the Pentagon, officials were discussing reports that state capitals were facing violence in what had the makings of a national insurrection. We must establish order, said Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, in a call with Pentagon leaders. But order would not be restored for hours. The Pentagon document was obtained by the Associated Press. It adds another layer of understanding about the fear and panic while the insurrection played out, lays bare the inaction by Trump, and shows how his refusal to call off his supporters contributed to a slowed response by the military and law enforcement. It shows that intelligence missteps, tactical errors and bureaucratic delays were eclipsed by the governments failure to comprehend the scale and intensity of a violent uprising by its own citizens. With Trump not engaged, it fell to Pentagon officials, a handful of senior White House aides, the leaders of Congress and Pence, holed up in a secure bunker, to attempt to manage the chaos. Along with hours of sworn testimony, the Pentagon document provides a still incomplete picture about how the insurrection advanced with such swift and lethal force, interrupting the congressional certification of Joe Biden as president and delaying the peaceful transfer of power. Five people, including a police officer, died as a direct result of the riot. More than 400 people have been charged. Lawmakers, still protected by national guard troops, will hear from the inspector general of the Capitol police this week. Any minute that we lost, I need to know why, Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of the Senate rules committee, which is investigating the siege, said last month. The Pentagon document provides a timeline that fills in some gaps. Just before noon on 6 January, Trump told supporters at a rally near the White House they should march to the Capitol. The crowd was at least 10,000 strong. By 1.15pm, the procession was well on its way. Some immediately became violent, busting through barriers and beating up officers who stood in their way. At 1.49pm, as violence escalated, the then Capitol police chief, Steven Sund, called Maj Gen William Walker, commander of the DC national guard, to request assistance. Sunds voice was cracking with emotion, Walker later told a Senate committee. Walker immediately called army leaders to inform them of the request. Twenty minutes later, around 2.10pm, rioters broke through the doors and windows of the Senate. They marched through the halls in search of lawmakers counting electoral votes. Alarms announced a lockdown. Sund asked for at least 200 guard members and more if they are available. But no help was immediately on the way. The Pentagon document details nearly two hours of confusion and chaos as officials attempted to work out a response. By 4.08pm, as rioters roamed the Capitol yelling for Pence to be hanged, the vice-president called Christopher Miller, the acting defense secretary, to demand answers. The call lasted only a minute. Pence asked for a deadline for securing the building. Trump broke his silence at 4.17pm, tweeting that his followers should go home and go in peace. By about 4.30pm, the military plan was finalized. Reports of state capitals breached turned out to be bogus. At about 4.40pm, Pelosi and Schumer were again on the phone with Gen Milley and Pentagon leaders. The congressional leadership accuse[d] the national security apparatus of knowing that protesters planned to conduct an assault on the Capitol, the Pentagon timeline says. The call lasted 30 minutes, including a discussion of intelligence failures. It would be another hour before the first 155 national guard members arrived. Dressed in riot gear, they started moving out the rioters. There were few if any arrests. At 8pm, the Capitol was declared secure."

            "content": "Prosecutors in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell have defended a late expansion of charges against her, saying it became necessary because a woman spoke after the Britons arrest about abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein in the early 2000s. Prosecutors also told a judge in New York they opposed any move to delay Maxwells trial, which is set to begin on 12 July. The rewritten indictment against the 59-year-old Maxwell, daughter of the press baron Robert Maxwell, was lodged on 29 March. It added sex trafficking charges to allegations Maxwell recruited three teenage girls from 1994 to 1997 for Epstein to sexually abuse. The new charges stretched the conspiracy to 2004. Two days after the superseding indictment was returned in Manhattan federal court, the defense attorney Bobbi Sternheim called it shocking, unfair, and an abuse of power, saying the charges were based on evidence prosecutors had for years. That the government has made this move late in the game  is obvious tactical gamesmanship, Sternheim wrote to the judge. Sternheim said defense lawyers had not decided whether to ask to postpone the trial, but her letter suggested it was highly likely and would be further grounds for Maxwells release on bail. On Friday, prosecutors wrote to the judge saying they would oppose any delay of a trial set for almost exactly a year after Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire. They said the timing of the new charges was dictated by developments in the governments ongoing investigation, not the nefarious motivations suggested by the defense. Prosecutors conceded the woman whose claims led to the new charges was interviewed in 2007 during an investigation of Epstein in Florida. But they said she did not agree to be interviewed in the current investigation until last July. Interviews were finished in January. Prosecutors said they had spent two months corroborating the womans claims before seeking the superseding indictment. Maxwells arraignment on the new charges is scheduled for this month. According to the indictment, the woman was sexually abused multiple times by Epstein between 2001 and 2004 at his residence in Palm Beach, Florida, beginning when she was 14 years old. It said Maxwell groomed the girl to engage in sex acts with Epstein by giving her gifts and cash. Epstein was facing sex trafficking charges when he killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty. She has been held without bail in Brooklyn. A judge has repeatedly rejected bail packages that would require the posting of $28.5m in assets and require Maxwell to remain home with armed guards. Prosecutors say they will oppose any request to grant bail if the trial is postponed. Defense lawyers say Maxwells health is deteriorating. Prosecutors say that is untrue."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 17.54 EDT Nasa is gearing up to attempt the first controlled flight on another planet next week, with the tiny Ingenuity helicopter on Mars. The helicopter is expected to take to the skies next week, with Wednesday being the earliest time scheduled. Ingenuity arrived at the Jezero Crater on the red planet on 18 February after an eight-month journey spanning nearly 300 million miles inside the Perseverance rover. Take-off had been scheduled for Monday, but Nasa said this was delayed after a technical issue during a rotor test, which means another test is now needed prior to the launch. The helicopter is 50cm tall and weighs 1.8kg on Earth, but, due to the red planets lower gravity, a mere 680g on Mars. It is armed with two rotors that spin in opposite directions to lift the drone off the ground. During a high-speed spin test of the rotors on Friday, the command sequence controlling the test ended early due to a watchdog timer expiration, Nasa said. This occurred as it was trying to transition the flight computer from Pre-Flight to Flight mode. The helicopter is safe and healthy and communicated its full telemetry set to Earth. The watchdog timer oversees the command sequence and alerts the system to any potential issues. It helps the system stay safe by not proceeding if an issue is observed and worked as planned. After the spacecraft landed, it dropped the drone on to the ground so the aircraft could prepare for its maiden flight. It is part of a technology demonstration: a project that aims to test a new capability for the first time. As such, it does not have any scientific instruments onboard. According to Nasa, one of Ingenuitys key objectives is to survive the bone-chilling temperatures of the planet with nights as cold as minus 90C. It also faces the challenge of flying in Marss atmosphere, which is about 100 times thinner than Earths. For its first flight, the helicopter will take off from the ground and hover in the air at about 3 metres for 20 to 30 seconds before descending and touching back down on the Martian surface. If successful, Nasa says it will be a major milestone  the very first powered flight in another world. The aircraft will then attempt additional experimental flights, which will involve travelling further distances and increasing altitudes. It is designed to be mostly autonomous so Nasa will not be able to control the helicopter remotely due to the distance between Earth and Mars. It takes more than 11 minutes to get a radio signal back to Earth. Last month the Perseverance rover sent back the first ever sounds of driving on the red planet  a grinding, clanking and banging noise."

            "content": "First published on Sat 10 Apr 2021 13.02 EDT David Cameron lobbied a senior Downing St aide and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on behalf of a now collapsed company run by the scandal-hit financier Lex Greensill, it has emerged. In further revelations that show the lengths the former prime minister went to in his attempts to secure political access for Greensill Capital, which paid him as an adviser, Cameron emailed a No 10 adviser after the Treasury rejected his attempts to secure the company access to a Covid emergency loan scheme. Cameron said it was nuts to exclude Greensills company from the scheme, according to emails seen by the Sunday Times. As a shareholder, Cameron stood to gain from Greensills long-term success. However, his shares are worthless after its collapse. A Downing St spokesperson said: Throughout the pandemic, an immense number of businesses contacted Downing Street with representations; these were passed on to relevant departments. It also emerged on Saturday night that, in 2019, Cameron took Greensill along with him to a private drink with Hancock. They lobbied Hancock to introduce a payment scheme that was later introduced for NHS staff. There are no minutes of Hancocks meeting with Cameron and Greensill. Later, NHS Shared Business Services (NHS SBS) announced a pilot scheme with Earnd, an outfit owned by Greensill, to pay NHS workers weekly or daily. It was a free service. An ally of Hancock said: Matt acted in entirely the correct way  he updated officials on the business that was discussed, as is appropriate. A Department of Health and Social Care Spokesperson said: The wellbeing of NHS staff is the top priority of the department and Health Secretary. Our approach was and is that local NHS employers are best placed to decide how different pay flexibilities fit with their overall pay and reward offer for their staff. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, called on chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was repeatedly lobbied by Cameron, to make a statement to parliament at the earliest opportunity and answer questions on this growing scandal. And we need a full and thorough investigation into what happened. The Observer can reveal that Cameron was in line to profit from a $30m (21.8m) employee benefit trust registered in Jersey thanks to his role with the collapsed Greensill Capital. The revelation comes amid calls for the former prime minister to disclose just how much he was in line to gain from his role advising the firm. It follows a week in which further details emerged of Camerons lobbying of ministers, as he sought to persuade them to hand Greensill access to government-backed financial aid schemes. Cameron repeatedly texted chancellor Rishi Sunak to grant the lender access to the Bank of Englands Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). Text messages released last week show Sunak telling Cameron he had pushed the team to explore an alternative with the Bank that might work. There was also a call between the men, but it is not known if officials listened in on the call or whether notes were taken. While access to the CCFF was ultimately rebuffed, Britains public spending watchdog is considering a request to investigate how Greensill Capital was later accredited to the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS), handing it the ability to access government-backed loans of up to 50m. Greensill records show 13,931 shares were held in two blocks by an offshore wealth manager, named as Jersey-based Sanne Fiduciary Services. A spokesperson for Sanne confirmed that these shares were held by two employee benefit trusts, reserved for stock options issued to employees. It is understood that none of the shares in these trusts had been distributed to staff by the time Greensill collapsed. Sanne said in a statement that it acted as a trustee to two employee benefit trusts established by Greensill Capital, and that it was a common structure used by companies who wanted to hold shares until they can be distributed to staff. Asked whether Cameron was one of the intended recipients of shares held in the trusts, Sanne and a source close to Cameron did not deny this was the case. A source close to Cameron said: These Sanne stake figures bear no relation to David Camerons remuneration and presumably refer to a large number of employees and advisers. The source disputed reports that Cameron told friends he was set for a $60m windfall if Greensill floated on the stock exchange. The figures being bandied around about his subsequent remuneration from Greensill are becoming increasingly inaccurate, the source said. His reported boast to friends about his remuneration is fiction, but people keep repeating it. Meanwhile, the National Audit Office (NAO) is examining whether to investigate claims that Greensill Capitals access to the scheme created a risk to public funds. While the NAO cannot look into Greensills business, it is able to investigate issues where value for public money is at stake. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has now written to Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, asking for an investigation. The government has stated that the decision to accredit Greensill to the loan scheme was taken independently by the British Business Bank (BBB) and involved a robust accreditation process. The BBB later withdrew the state guarantee to Greensills loans. A spokesperson for Greensill Capital did not comment."

            "content": "In some government circles, the excitement before Britains opening-up and return to something like normality is making ministers giddy. Grant Shapps says everyone may start booking a foreign holiday now that he is at work revamping last years colour-coded map of the world. With a traffic-light system of testing and quarantine rules in place, it is likely that nowhere will be out of bounds for Britons to visit. Inside No 10, last years recession is forgotten and the possibilities during the second half of the year are considered to be almost boundless. Just the thought of public gatherings and nights at the theatre has allowed the prime minister to relax back into his pie-and-a-pint bonhomie, setting aside the accusations of bungling and lying so eloquently laid out in Peter Obornes book The Assault on Truth, or the way Brexit seems to be hastening the breakup of Britains union of nations. In recent weeks, every forecast of economic growth has acquired a healthier glow. Last week, the International Monetary Fund added its voice to those saying the global economy  and the UKs in particular  would enjoy a broader and faster expansion than previously estimated. The UK is expected to grow by 5.3% in 2021 and by 5.1% in 2022, making it the fastest-growing G7 country at the end of the forecast period. Senior figures at the Bank of England have fuelled the prime ministers sense that a period of unalloyed jollity, singing and dancing is within sight by using phrases such as coiled spring to describe the strength of the bounce-back. Investment bank economists and business groups paint a similar picture: one where Britain looks like a hive of activity, wheeling and dealing its way to prosperity in a way that boosts the traditional measure of national income  GDP. It is clear, though, that all the talk of reinventing the post-Covid economy has so far been just that: talk. Last weeks Halifax house price data showed that traditional markers of success remain paramount inside Downing Street. House prices gained 1.1% in March compared with February, taking them 6.5% higher than they were in March 2020  well ahead of Februarys average 0.4% inflation rate and median annual pay settlements of 1% in the three months ending 28 February, according to XpertHR. The Treasury has pumped house prices higher with taxpayer-funded concessions on stamp duty that mean the 500,000 tax-free threshold will remain until 30 June and until 30 September at 250,000, before returning to its original level of 125,000. The booming shares of the big housebuilders show what we have known for decades: that government subsidies for home purchases are channelled into property-industry profits via higher prices. It is the same old Tory practice of favouring an industry that makes donations to its election war chest, cloaked in PR messages about turning Generation Rent into Generation Buy. Building on flood plains continues apace and housing density, not biodiversity, remains the highest priority of the housing minister, Robert Jenrick. Meanwhile, the government has scrapped its most ambitious and costly measure to tackle climate change, the 1.5bn green homes grant, and halved the science research budget for universities, leaving a 2bn hole in research funding overall. Councils are kept on a shoestring budget, and grants for levelling up are not only shovelled out by the Treasury as short-term fixes, preventing local groups from making plans beyond one year, but have become tainted as yet another way to favour Tory electoral ambitions. Jagjit Chadha, the head of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, is not the only one to despair at the lack of a coherent basis on which the government is devising economic policies and then judging their success, especially against climate goals. Policies masquerade as strategic when the only consistent thing about them is that they are tactical. The Dasgupta review, commissioned by the May government, has called for a form of national accounting that includes the depletion of natural resources, because of the risk that all social and economic gains could be undermined by catastrophic increases in temperature. Its 600 pages could be the welcome, if belated, opportunity for the Johnson administration to rewrite the standard economic rules, handing ministers such as Jenrick a fresh basis for policymaking. Cambridge Universitys Bennett Institute for Public Policy has put forward a method for remodelling GDP to accommodate such things as the natural environment. Maybe it is too early to judge whether the prime minister will emerge from the pandemic armed with anything more than a smile and some back-slapping bonhomie. Sadly, the omens are not good."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 17.26 EDT Leading scientists warned last night that the government was risking a third wave of Covid-19 by easing the lockdown at a time when official data still shows virus hotspots across many parts of the country. With the UK poised to lift many Covid restrictions on Monday, the scientists accuse ministers of abandoning their promises to follow the data, not dates in a rush to reopen society and the economy. A more cautious, sensible approach would be to wait until more among the tens of millions of people who have yet to be inoculated have had their vaccinations, they say. In addition, they point out that without an adequate system for isolating people who become infected, there could be significant rises in daily Covid cases that could erupt over the next few weeks. Stephen Griffin, of Leeds University medical school, told the Observer: There are areas in West Yorkshire, the Black Country and other regions that still have high infection rates. However, many people there cannot afford to self-isolate. We need to tackle that issue urgently or the virus will come back again. The government has said it would not lift restrictions until infection levels are low enough but Griffin said that its promise to follow data not dates now appeared to have been abandoned. Its worrying, he added. They are saying one thing and doing another  again. There are far too many virus hotspots and not enough attention being paid to controlling infections that might spread from them. While the average number of cases per 100,000 people is 30.7 across the whole UK, 28 local authority areas have at least double that number, with five  Wakefield, Barnsley, Mansfield, Corby and Clackmannanshire  recording at least three times as many. Professor Lawrence Young of Warwick medical school added: The test, trace and isolate system that is supposed to contain outbreaks has not worked well, and even when people test positive, they are not isolating. We need a properly funded system for quarantining infected people. We dont have that and that raises the risk we could head back into trouble again quite quickly. While there is still criticism in scientific circles, overall approval for the governments handling of the pandemic is now positive for the first time since May 2020, in the latest sign that the vaccine rollout has helped transform its fortunes. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer found that 44% now approve of the governments Covid handling, with 36% disapproving. Driving the approval is support for the vaccine distribution programme, with 72% approving of the efforts and only 8% disapproving. Support is high even among Labour (71%) and SNP voters (57%). A majority of voters (54%) believe the governments roadmap out of Covid restrictions is at about the right pace, up slightly from 47% a fortnight ago. Scientists also worry that vaccine acceptance by younger people could be affected by reports of rare cases of blood clots being linked to the AstraZeneca jab. That is also a concern, said Young. The government needs to generate a really strong communication campaign around the vaccine to reassure people that everything is safe. The poll shows clear majority support among the public for taking the vaccine but concerns among young people over possible side-effects. Among those who havent been offered a vaccine, 59% of 18-34-year-olds said they definitely would take one if offered and 17% probably would. Among the same age group, 44% said they were concerned about adverse effects, up from 42%. From tomorrow, food and drink can be served outside again while non-essential retailers will reopen, along with gyms, hairdressers, spas, libraries and community centres. Overnight stays away from home in England will be permitted and self-contained accommodation can reopen, though only for members of the same household or support bubble. Zoos, theme parks, drive-in cinemas and drive-in performances events can also reopen. Further easing of restrictions  including allowing two households to meet indoors  are likely on 17 May. Some scientists fear that case numbers will need to be far lower before the next set of restrictions are lifted. The government announced on Saturday that a further 40 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 127,080. Meanwhile, the government faced renewed criticism over its Covid travel policy. A travel trade body on Saturday called for an investigation into the costs of coronavirus tests for people in the UK wanting to go abroad on holiday this year. A framework for the resumption of overseas leisure travel has been announced by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, which includes requiring all passengers to take pre-departure and post-arrival coronavirus tests. Post-arrival tests must be the PCR type, which cost about 120. The requirement has led to a furious backlash from the travel industry, which wants travellers from low-risk countries to take lateral flow tests, which are cheaper and quicker."

            "content": "First published on Sat 10 Apr 2021 12.00 EDT Prince Charles has paid tribute to his dear papa as details of the Duke of Edinburghs funeral plans emerged, including Prince Philips special request that his coffin be borne on a Land Rover. Speaking at Highgrove, the Prince of Wales said: My dear papa was a very special person who I think above all else would have been amazed by the reaction and the touching things that have been said about him. Charles, offering a statement on behalf of members of the royal family, said that he already missed his father enormously but had taken solace from the worldwide reaction to Prince Philips death, aged 99. Charles spoke after it was announced that Philips funeral would be held on Saturday, with the Duke of Sussex quickly confirming he would travel from California to attend. However Prince Harrys wife Meghan, who is pregnant, will not be attending on the advice of her physician, a palace spokesperson announced. It was also announced on Saturday evening that Boris Johnson would not attend the dukes funeral, to allow for as many family members as possible to be present given coronavirus restrictions. A specially modified Land Rover carrying the Duke of Edinburgh will be flanked by pall bearers drawn from the Royal Marines as it transports the coffin. Prince Philip had a role in the design of the vehicle and had always wanted it to be involved in his funeral, a senior aide said. Prince Charless statement also paid tribute to his fathers remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth. He added: He was a much loved and appreciated figure and apart from anything else, I can imagine he would be so deeply touched by the number of other people here and elsewhere around the world and the Commonwealth, who also, I think, share our loss and our sorrow. His comments followed a day of gun salutes throughout the UK and tributes from political leaders and royal families from across the world. At Buckingham Palace, its flag flying at half-mast, a steady stream of well-wishers paid their respects, though the crowds were vastly slimmed down following warnings to stay away because of coronavirus restrictions. From midday, batteries fired 41 rounds in cities including London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, as well as from Royal Navy warships at sea. At the mouth of the Mediterranean, the Royal Gibraltar regiment also joined in the salute. The government confirmed that the period of national mourning will continue until after the funeral. Separately, the Queen has decided that a two-week period of royal mourning will be observed by members of the royal family, who will undertake appropriate engagements while wearing black mourning bands. Saturdays funeral, it was announced by Buckingham Palace on Saturday, will be confined entirely to Windsor Castle, following an eight-minute ceremonial procession within the castles grounds. Vastly reduced in scale due to the pandemic and to comply with current government public health guidelines, the funeral plans have been given final approval by the Queen and reflect current government advice, the palace said. There will be no public access, although the service and short procession will be televised. It will be a ceremonial royal funeral, as was the Queen Mothers, and as befits Prince Philips senior royal status. The service, at St Georges Chapel, will commence at 3pm and will begin with a national one-minute silence. From across the globe, tributes poured in throughout the day for the duke who made hundreds of overseas visits including 229 journeys to 67 Commonwealth countries. Among those sending their thoughts were Spains king and queen, King Felipe and Queen Letizia, who sent a telegram forwarding all our love and affection."

            "content": "First published on Sat 10 Apr 2021 11.15 EDT Donald Trump was scheduled to speak on Saturday at a Republican National Committee event held at his Mar-a-Lago resort, amid a weekend of summits and dinners in the former presidents corner of Florida. The Republican rush to court Trump  and to pay for the use of his properties  is proving highly profitable. According to the Washington Post, attendees at the 400-person banquet planned for Saturday paid more than $100,000 each to attend. On Saturday night, Trump was reportedly set to tell attendees: I stand before you this evening filled with confidence that in 2022, we are going to take back the House and we are going to reclaim the Senate  and then in 2024, a Republican candidate is going to win the White House. Nonetheless, debate continues over Trumps place in a party he led to victory in one presidential election but then shepherded to defeat in another while losing the House and the Senate after four years of chaos and two impeachment trials. His spokesman, Jason Miller, told the Post he was still the biggest name in politics. A leading presidential historian countered, telling the Associated Press that where once Trump was like Zeus  shooting tweets like thunderbolts from up high, now he only released little squeaks from the mouse of Mar-a-Lago. As Republicans begin to mull their choice of presidential nominee for 2024, senators, governors and other figures are jostling for prominence and courting major donors. An unnamed attendee at events in Florida this weekend, an adviser to a top donor, told Politico the partys focus was on limiting Trumps influence in order to win back suburban voters who deserted him for Joe Biden. The thing on every donors mind, the person was quoted as saying, is how much sway Trump should have. Trump, however, consistently tops polls of Republican voters. He is also fervently courted for endorsements. In Florida on Friday he both hosted and endorsed Marco Rubio, a senator and former presidential rival many had thought likely to attract a challenge from Trumps daughter Ivanka. Public appearances are also keenly sought. Amy Kremer of Women for America First, a conservative group holding an event at another Trump property, his golf course in Doral, Florida, told the Post: We would love to see him. If he came and spoke to the group spending the weekend here, that would be great. If he came and played golf and people watched him  that would be great too. Nonetheless some observers think Trumps grip is slipping, not least because he has lost access to Twitter, his most powerful communication platform, for inciting the Capitol attack. Trumps power is waning by the day, Alex Conant, a Republican consultant, told the AP. When youre president of the United States its very easy to insert yourself into every news cycle. But once youve left office, it has to be more strategic. Conant said Trump should have announced a book, sat for primetime interviews or delivered speeches. Instead he has taken to releasing short tweet-like statements, sent straight to journalists by email. Trump has said he is developing his own social media platform but he has also said his statements work better than online messages. Speaking to the AP, Miller insisted Trump was still the greatest news generator in American history and said: There was never this type of media interest in the post-presidential careers of Clinton, Bush or Obama. Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary under George W Bush, disagreed. Though Trump looms large in the Republican party, he said, and was unlike any prior president in the amount of oxygen he sucked up  he increasingly resembles many former presidents in how little oxygen he now gets. Harold Holzer, director of Hunter Colleges Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute, said: I dont think its unnatural for coverage to diminish. Im sure its tough on his ego, given  how much ink he generates, but its not unnatural for an ex-president to get less attention. Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, was harsher. I think he lost all momentum when he got pulled from the platforms, he said. Politics is about momentum and he has none now. Where it used to be he was shooting tweets like Zeus, they were like thunderbolts from up high. Now its little squeaks from the mouse of Mar-a-Lago. One election result this week did show Trumps influence on key electoral battles: voters in the small Illinois town of Mettewa re-elected a mayor who ran a write-in campaign after Trump pardoned him in a gambling investigation. Casey Urlacher, the brother of the former Chicago Bears star Brian Urlacher, pleaded not guilty to federal charges of recruiting bettors in exchange for a cut of their losses. After the president pardoned him, he beat Jess Ray  by 151 votes to 105."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 14.58 EDT Fears are growing over how GCSEs and A-levels will be awarded in England this summer, with headteachers under pressure to carry out an excessive number of assessments on students and use historical data about previous pupils past performance to unjustly suppress the grades of individual high achievers. New government guidance, issued to headteachers shortly before the Easter holidays, has sent schools in England into a state of panic and is unfair on pupils, teachers say. Some schools are asking GCSE students to sit as many as 35 exams over the next four to six weeks, so that they have recent evidence to justify the grades they are awarding. But before they hand out any grades, headteachers have been instructed by Ofqual to consider their schools results in previous years as a guide to help them to check that their judgments are not unduly harsh or lenient. Last summer, Ofqual created a controversial algorithm that relied on historical data about a schools previous performance to determine the grades of pupils unable to take their exams during the pandemic. Thousands of bright pupils at poor-performing and improving state schools saw their results unfairly downgraded from their teachers assessments as a result. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said there was a risk that Ofquals guidance could distort results and lead to inappropriate grades being awarded this summer, too. It may suppress the grades of a year group which has more able students than in the previous years. It could lead to injustices, she said. Its imposing a data-driven outcome rather than an achievement-driven outcome. Teachers are expected to award students evidence-based grades, with more recent evidence deemed to be more representative of student performance, according to the recent guidance issued to schools by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). This has sent schools into an evidence-gathering frenzy. At one London comprehensive, pupils taking 10 GCSEs have 35 separate assessments to do over the next six weeks. It is intimidating, said one 16-year-old, who did not wish to be named. Im trying not to think about it so that I dont get stressed. Headteacher Jules White, leader of the WorthLess? school funding campaign, agreed headteachers across England are feeling under pressure to gather the evidence they need: There is a danger schools will carry out too many exams when the whole point is that they were cancelled because everyone agreed that they couldnt be carried out fairly. A range of evidence should be used rather than solely re-running exams by the backdoor. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We trust teachers decisions on grading and the evidence they need to assess pupils. JCQ has published guidance to support teachers, schools and colleges with their processes, including on using historic data, helping to maximise consistency across the country and fairness. She added that the guidance is clear that grading judgments should not be driven by this data. A spokesperson for Ofqual said it had been mindful of the impact on teacher workload. We expect teachers to use a range of evidence to arrive at a grade, and to use their professional judgment when deciding how to assess and grade their students. Schools, it said, will be required, as part of their overall quality assurance, to consider the performance of this years cohort compared to previous years when exams have taken place, to make sure they have not been overly lenient or harsh in their assessmentsof the 2021 cohort. They are not expected to use information from previous years to artificially suppress grades."

            "content": "Australias bushfires were devastating for bee populations. But steady rain and community efforts are seeing the return of the pollinators Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 19.42 EDT You could say that Adrian Iodice is something of a stickybeak neighbour. On Iodices once-lush bushland property, nestled within the Bega Valley of New South Wales, there stands a majestic rough-barked apple tree that the beekeeper used to, every now and then, jam his head into. In the hollow of the trunk lived a flourishing wild colony of European honeybees that Iodice had been keeping an eye on for years. Id have a chat with them, he laughs. Stick my head in and see how theyre getting on in life. They were very gentle bees; they never had a go at me. In the wake of the black summer bushfires of 2019-20 that torched his land and home, Iodices thoughts turned to the abode of his insect neighbours. So I went over and stuck my head in the hollow as usual, but they werent there, he says. A lot of the wax had melted out, with just the residue left. I got quite emotional. Iodice had been keeping watch on about a dozen wild hives dotted around his property. All were lost to the flames. Even the trees that survived, the colonies burnt out anyway because of the way hollows act as chimneys in a fire, he says. All animals in those hollows would have suffered the same fate. To look at the trees still standing, and knowing where those beehives had been  to see no activity whatsoever was quite shocking. It was a similar story right across the firegrounds of Australias black summer. The honey industry reported at least 2.5bn honeybees in NSW and Victoria alone were killed in the fires. As Iodice notes, the loss of pollinators such as bees and wasps has profound implications for any ecosystem, let alone one recovering from an unprecedented fire event. Plants cant get up and run across the paddock to make love to each other; they need bees to transport the pollen, he says. Youre not going to have that regeneration without them  without pollinators theres no ecosystem at all. Iodice wanted to do something about it  and he wasnt alone. Local organisations such as Bee Day Australia offered to support his plans for restoration projects. Help also arrived from overseas, with the UKs Natural Beekeeping Trust flying over BoomtreeBees expert Michael Verspuij to help train Iodice in how to build log hives. Armed with that newfound knowledge, Iodice picked over the charred remains of bushland to find logs with the insides burnt just right to be carved into the large cavities that honeybees prefer. By doing that, wed stop the honeybees from taking over smaller hollows more suitable for sugar gliders and birds, he says. Iodice and his team hoisted these log hives up into the trees, where they were protected from subsequent disaster events, such as the recent floods that swept through NSW and drowned out ground-level commercial beehives. Iodice built bee hotels for native bees and wasps, and collaborated with Indigenous organisation Back to Country to conduct a healing ceremony in the Bega Valley, where locals planted native plant species to facilitate the return of pollinators. Its one example of the efforts to restore Australias bee population in the wake of such a cataclysmic event. Generous rainfall through spring and summer catalysed a remarkable bounceback in insect populations, benefiting not just the environment, but the honey industry and farms that depend on pollinators. With around 10,000 commercial beehives lost in the bushfires across the state, the NSW Apiarists Association scrambled to share the surviving hives among regions in need of pollinators, such as orange orchards in the Riverina. The recovery has been so strong that in southern NSW, honey production has increased by between 60 and 100% compared with 2019. The Victorian Apiarists Association president, Phillip McPherson, said the steady rain also benefited his states bee population, and believes Victoria will have its best autumn production in years. He estimates the states honey industry lost at least a thousand hives in the fires, but notes the impact wasnt as severe as north of the border. The VAA has worked to support their NSW counterparts, connecting apiarists in need with suitable sites. A number of beekeepers came across the border and wintered in central Victoria last year, staying until the almonds were pollinated, McPherson says. Basha Stasak, the nature program manager at the Australian Conservation Foundation, says although bee numbers bounced back following the destruction of vast tracts of flowering trees in the bushfires, our buzzing friends continue to face serious challenges. There are concerns some insecticides used by agricultural industries are killing bees, and the ongoing problem of land clearing in Australia is bad news for bees. Stasak warned that Australias national environmental protections were failing to protect their habitat. Since Australias national environment law took effect 20 years ago, an area of threatened species habitat the size of Tasmania has been logged, cleared and bulldozed, she says. On Kangaroo Island in South Australia, apiarists are likewise working to rebound from the black summer devastation to the local bee population. Adelaide beekeepers travel to the island every few months to help rebuild the hives of Ligurian honeybees. Non-honey-producing native bees have also received assistance, including the rare green carpenter bee that lost most of its Kangaroo Island habitat in the fires. The Wheen Bee Foundation has drawn on its strategic bee rebuild and recovery fund to finance new nesting stalks for the native bee, built by volunteers at the Kingscote mens shed. Entomologist Dr Katja Hogendoorn from the University of Adelaide, who is conducting surveys of the green carpenter bee population, is matter-of-fact about the scale of the challenge. Ninety-nine percent of the habitat burnt, she says. The remnant population is now so low that we are not certain it is viable. According to Hogendoorn, it is too early to tell if the nesting stalks will be enough. We will know from the uptake in two years, she says. Hogendoorn notes that while the jury is out on whether introduced honeybees are a competitive threat to their native counterparts, she is nevertheless encouraging the islands honey industry to leave some space for the green carpenter bee to try and reestablish itself. Back in NSW, Iodice says he has copped vitriol online from people critical of his efforts to encourage wild colonies of European honeybees. What people dont understand is when ecosystems are facing the level of devastation they did in the fires, any life is good life, he says. Iodice is not done yet. Using some of his insurance payout from the bushfires, hes bought a caravan to tour Australia with his family, staging workshops on natural beekeeping and log hives. One thing I highlight is that natural beekeeping relies on a relationship between bees and the beekeeper, he says. If you treat them nicely, they tend to be very tolerant of us, so I teach students how to be gentle. There are signs theyre giving us about when we can work with them. Reflecting on the initial restoration after the fires, he recalls how getting the community together to plant pollination patches didnt just aid the bushland. Those locals who had lost everything, they were not just helping the environment  they were making a new start for themselves."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 18.42 EDT Htet Htet Win and her husband were late returning home on Sunday night. It was past the junta-imposed 8pm curfew when their motorbike passed through the streets of eastern Mandalay. The security forces reportedly shouted for them to stop, and then opened fire when they did not do so. Her husband was hit but managed to get away. She was knocked to the ground. A grainy photograph, taken by an onlooker, shows her lying face down on the concrete, her arms reaching above her head, her purple top and bottoms marked with dark patches. Doctors believed she was still alive, but were warned by residents that soldiers were waiting nearby. They feared it was a trap. I felt like they were ambushing us, said one of the rescuers. I think she would have survived if we were able to pick her up as soon as it happened, he said. They waited for more than an hour before the soldiers eventually retreated. It was too late. For medics in Myanmar, it is a grimly familiar story. Doctors told the Observer they were routinely targeted with violence by the military, and prevented from treating the victims of its bloody attacks. They recounted attacks in which security forces  trying to suppress defiant opposition to the February coup  had raided their facilities, searched and fired at their ambulances, detained, beaten and even killed their colleagues. It came as at least 82 people were reported to have been killed in one day in a crackdown by Myanmar security forces on pro-democracy protesters, according to reports on Saturday from independent local media and an organisation that keeps track of casualties since the militarys February seizure of power. Fridays death toll in Bago was the biggest one-day total for a single city since 14 March, when more than 100 people were killed in Yangon, the countrys biggest city. Bago is about 60 miles (100km) north-east of Yangon. The preliminary death toll of 82, which has not been independently verified, was compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which issues daily counts of casualties and arrests from the crackdown in the aftermath of the 1 February coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Raha Wala, of the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights, said the military was systematically persecuting medics, both for treating anti-coup protesters and, in the case of many government doctors, for participating in a national strike. Every few days, news spreads of more detentions of medical staff, taken at clinics, protests or from their homes during night raids. Some are released after questioning, others are less fortunate. If you are detained today, your body will be returned tomorrow with torture marks or something like that, said a Yangon-based doctor in hiding. Last Saturday, the orthopaedic surgeon and university professor Dr Kyaw Min Soe was taken from his home in Yangon. A photograph apparently taken at the scene shows him being led into a van, a bag placed over his head and his hands tied behind his back. Since then, two paediatricians have been taken in Mandalay; a clinic has been raided in Yangon, with soldiers detaining four volunteers according to local reports; a facility has been raided in Monywa, where two staff were taken to a police station for questioning, according to a local source, and another facility in Kale was reportedly raided, though no staff were present at the time. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which has tracked hundreds of deaths, at least five medics have been killed in the violence. Among them was nursing student Thinzar Hein, 20, who was shot dead while caring for injured protesters in Monywa on 28 March. She had protested against the coup and shared her medical expertise with others. Its like we are facing barbarians, said a doctor in Mandalay, who described being fired at while trying to attend to a patient, despite being dressed as a medic. We were wearing scrubs, a medic sign and wearing a stethoscope, he said. On a separate occasion, on 27 March, his ambulance was shot at as he attempted to pick up an injured patient. His colleagues, he said, were detained and beaten when they attempted to collect a dead body on 1 April. They [the military] want to take away all the evidence, he said. In some areas, medics no longer wear uniforms, fearing this puts them at even greater risk. Government doctors who are refusing to work in state hospitals  but are finding ways to treat patients elsewhere  are especially vulnerable. They were among the first groups to announce a strike after the coup, prompting huge numbers of workers, in services ranging from customs to transport, to down tools, bringing the country to a virtual standstill. While many governments have condemned the violence against peaceful protesters, and the UN security council has expressed concern at restrictions on medical staff, the brutality has continued. On Friday, military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun accused government doctors of murder, claiming their strike had contributed to Covid deaths. They are killing people in cold blood, he said. At least 618 people have been killed by the military since it seized power, while thousands have been detained, mostly in unknown locations. Seeing dying patients is not a strange thing for a doctor, but these days it is heartbreaking because the patients are just teenagers, said a second doctor in Mandalay. If medical teams were able to treat the injured safely, the death toll would not be so high, she added, describing how she has previously had to flee her clinic, along with patients, when the military approached. At least 43 children have been killed by security forces, the youngest just six years old. We even cry when we do the CPR. But we encourage each other, we need to move on because we cant be like that, the doctor said."

            "content": "Last modified on Sat 10 Apr 2021 19.54 EDT Halls Island, on Lake Malbena in the Walls of Jerusalem national park, is not easy to reach. It takes a strenuous eight-hour walk or a helicopter ride to get there. Its remoteness meant it was relatively little known until it became the site of the type of conservation battle that Tasmania has become famous for in a storied history that takes in fights over hydroelectricity dams, old-growth forestry and salmon farming. In 2015, an ecotourism business, Wild Drake, proposed a small tourism development on the island. Described as a luxury standing camp, it would involve four demountable huts housing up to six visitors at a time and helicopter flights into the Tasmanian world heritage wilderness up to 60 days a year. The Tasmanian Liberal government has been a strong supporter as it pushes to become what the premier, Peter Gutwein, has called the ecotourism capital of the world. According to the environment and parks minister, Roger Jaensch, the development can be appropriate, sensitive [and] manage the values of the world heritage area its operating in. Conservationists say new government documents released shortly before the Tasmanian election was called have cast this in doubt. Seen by Guardian Australia, they include a previously unreleased assessment by the states Parks and Wildlife Service that found the development could lead to the loss of 700 hectares of high-quality wilderness area and reduce the quality of at least 4,200 hectares  an area 23 times the size of the Melbourne CBD. They say the parks agencys wilderness quality assessment, undertaken in March last year, undermines the case for the Halls Island development and calls into question the governments policy of backing more privately-owned tourism developments on protected public land. Since being elected in 2014, the Liberals have called for expressions of interest from tourist operators for this sort of project and plan to continue the policy if re-elected on 1 May. It has given initial approval to 29 projects of various scales, including guided walks with private huts in the southwest national park and other world heritage areas. The Wilderness Society says the Halls Island proposal, which currently sits with the federal government, should also be seen as a test case with implications beyond Tasmania as other states including Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia back developments in national parks. The groups state campaign manager, Tom Allen, who obtained the documents under freedom-of-information laws, says the parks agency had found the development would degrade the very thing theyre supposed to look after, and the very thing people visit Tasmania to experience  the worlds most highly-rated world heritage wilderness. The supporters of the parks privatisation push keep talking about sensitive development when this shows it is actually destructive to world heritage wilderness, he says. The proponent of the Halls Island development argues otherwise. Wild Drakes Daniel Hackett, who runs a fly-fishing tour guide business with his wife Simone, says he asked the parks agency to do the newly released wilderness assessment and does not dispute what it found. He just disputes what it means. Hackett says it shows the projects impact on wilderness is only the proposed helicopter access, that the total annual flying time would be just 45 hours, that there would be no impact on the 300 days a year when there were no helicopter flights, and that 700 hectares of lost high-quality wilderness equates to just 0.05% of total high-quality wilderness in Tasmanias vast world heritage area. He argues presentation  tourism  is a Unesco obligation for the world heritage area alongside conservation, and that air access to Halls Island is more environmentally friendly than bushwalking through bogs and sensitive wetlands. It also allows us to share the wild places with a broader group of respectful visitors whom otherwise wouldnt get to know and protect this place, Hackett says. For the Wilderness Society to say that this level of impact is in any way significant is quite frankly ridiculous. The Wilderness Society is looking for conflict when we should all be working to conserve and share Tasmanias wild places. This goes to the heart of the dispute: whether any commercial development in world heritage wilderness  and any loss of the high-quality wilderness values that led to areas such as the Walls of Jerusalem national park being protected in the first place, no matter how small  is justified. The Halls Island proposal is currently before the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, who last year found the proposal was on a scale that warranted assessment under the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Protection (EPBC) Act. Explaining her reasoning last September, Ley appeared to disagree with the Tasmanian government and Hackett that his proposal would have limited impact. She said the advice that she had received  which included the parks wilderness assessment  indicated the scale of impact on the world heritage areas values would be substantial. But she stressed this did not mean her decision had already been made. Her ruling followed public opposition, including from bushwalkers and fishers, and legal challenges. Ley used her discretion to order the assessment against the advice of her department, and effectively reversed an earlier decision made under the former environment minister, Melissa Price, that was overturned by the federal court. The new parks assessment is consistent with an analysis commissioned by the Wilderness Society in 2018, and follows warnings from the Australian Heritage Council and the National Parks and Wildlife Advisory Council. The Tasmanian Aboriginal Heritage Council has raised concerns from a cultural perspective. It also appears at odds with the parks agencys consistent public support for the Halls Island development. Allen says the governments plan to allow private development in parks was flawed from the start. It called for expressions of interest, which were assessed by a panel against four criteria before being publicly announced as having government support. He says the process lacked transparency and in some cases regulations had been watered down to allow developments to go ahead. In the case of the Halls Island development, the part of the world heritage area in which it sits was rezoned from wilderness to self-reliant recreation. Among the Wilderness Societys objections is its belief that public land is being privatised for profit without transparency. Luke Martin, the chief executive of the Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, says the science of whether there is impact on world heritage areas is best left to experts, but critics such as the Wilderness Society and the Greens have an ideological opposition to any development proposal in parks. He says every plan is unique and should be assessed on its merits. We think there is a role for commercial development in national parks and the world heritage area, he says. Every form of human activity is going to have an impact on the wilderness values. Its just a matter of how you can do that in a minimal way that has a minimum impact on the environment and allows people to experience these places. Martin is dismissive of claims the Halls Island proposal would be the thin edge of the wedge or that developments are being rushed through without transparency. Seriously, look how long it has taken to get anywhere, he says. We are not seeing this massive onslaught of projects. The Liberal party says it remains committed to its policy. Through a spokesperson, it says its approach has been very successful over many years in promoting Tasmanias unique wilderness and nature-based tourism experiences on the world stage, and that all proposals including that for Halls Island need to receive official heritage, environmental and cultural approval. The Labor opposition, led by Rebecca White, did not respond before publication. The Greens say the parks assessment is an indictment on the government as it shows its policy would allow damage to the very values that underpin the reserve. Vica Bayley, a Greens candidate and longtime environmental campaigner, says both the world heritage committee and state laws for managing national parks are clear that wilderness should be protected from developments such as huts and helicopters. This new assessment demonstrates that those impacts are real, he says. He says the government has pushed all the way to approve the Halls Island development. Now they have done this assessment the question is: what happens to it? The logical thing parks could so is review the current assessment, cancel the approval and strengthen the process to ensure it doesnt happen again. Allen says the Wilderness Societys position is that it supports nature tourism, but that development should be outside protected areas. We recognise that properly managed tourism has lots of upsides and it is better than extractive industries. There is a beautiful win-win out there of properly managed tourism and conservation working together, he says. But if Tasmania wants to be the ecotourism capital of the world it has to be serious about these things. It cant go on the way it has been."

When the company gives its latest financial update this week, it will be telling a very different story: in the past 12 months its market value has more than tripled and a maiden profit is looming as Audioboom joins the ranks of the pandemic winners. Digital entertainment services from Netflix to Spotify have been supercharged by lockdown viewing and listening, and Audioboom has been no exception. It now draws 25 million listeners a month with content from partners ranging from Formula One to the former Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins. Audioboom, which counts Nick Candys investment firm as its biggest shareholder, saw revenues hit a record $26.8m last year, and losses almost halve to $1.7m. This has been fuelled by an advertiser boom creating a surge in the amount of money the firm now makes from the 85 million times its podcasts are downloaded and listened to each month. The momentum shows no signs of slowing, with Stuart Last, the chief executive, already hailing 2021 as a breakthrough year, and analysts forecasting the 12-year-old business will make its first profit since it listed in London in 2014. The drop-off in advertising demand traditionally seen in the first quarter has failed to materialise this year, as continuing coronavirus restrictions leave millions of people with limited entertainment options. The business has already hit 80% of its forecast advertising revenue, and its first-quarter update, on 14 April, is likely to bring investors even more joy. Shares have surged more than 250% over the past year, giving Audioboom a market value of 95m  a minnow-esque figure compared with global rivals, but one which house broker Allenby Capital believes indicates that the company is still significantly undervalued. Last October, Audioboom sold a stake to a new Singaporean investor, raising 3m to invest in its own original content as it spied the risk of being outbid by deep-pocketed rivals when podcast partner deals come up for renewal. Earlier this month it launched Dark Air, a comedy series written by and starring Rainn Wilson from the US version of The Office, and extended its official podcast partner deal with Formula One to 2023. Spotify has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on podcast companies and top talent, including deals with the Obamas and Harry and Meghans production company, in the battle for crown-jewel content and scale. It said its strategy of diversifying away from music was paying off: podcast listening hours doubled in the final quarter last year, and this had been a significant factor in its 27% year-on-year increase in users, the company reported. Last December, Amazon acquired Wondery, the network behind podcasts including Dirty John and Dr. Death, as it, too, adds audio content to its Amazon Music service. Audiobooms revenues are growing at almost twice the rate of the US podcasting ad market  the worlds biggest, at an estimated $1bn  and the recent buying spree has left few large-scale, independent contenders in the market. Audiobooms investors will be hoping its growth story might soon be enough to get on the buy list of one the global players."

            "content": "First published on Sat 10 Apr 2021 11.22 EDT Extremely heavy ashfall rained down on parts of the Caribbean island of St Vincent on Saturday and a strong sulfur smell enveloped communities, a day after a powerful explosion at La Soufriere volcano uprooted the lives of thousands who evacuated under government orders. Caribbean countries including Antigua and Guyana offered help by either shipping emergency supplies or temporarily opening borders to the roughly 16,000 evacuees fleeing ash-covered communities. The volcano, which last had a sizeable eruption in 1979, kept rumbling and experts warned explosions could continue for days or weeks. An eruption in 1902 killed about 1,600 people. The first bang is not necessarily the biggest bang this volcano will give, Richard Robertson, a geologist with the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Center, said at a news conference. Conditions worsened overnight in settlements near the volcano as ash covered homes, cars and streets. Lush green scenery had turned gray and gloomy, with people leaving footprints as they walked through the soot. The prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, told NBC Radio, a local station, that officials were trying to figure out how to remove the ash. Its difficult to breathe, Gonsalves said, adding that while the volcanos venting had diminished, a big plume of ash and smoke remained. What goes up must come down. He asked people to remain calm and keep protecting themselves from the coronavirus as he celebrated that no deaths or injuries were reported after the eruption in the northern tip of St Vincent, part of an island chain that includes the Grenadines and is home to more than 100,000 people. Agriculture will be badly affected and we may have some loss of animals and we will have to do repairs to houses, but if we have life and we have strength, we will build it back better, stronger, together, he said. Gonsalves has said it could take up to four months for life to return to normal. About 3,200 people were staying in 78 government shelters while four empty cruise ships floated nearby, waiting to take evacuees to nearby islands. Those staying in shelters were tested for Covid-19, and anyone testing positive would be taken to an isolation center. Gonsalves said it was unclear how much more ash the volcano would vent out. All Im asking of everybody is to be calm, he told reporters during a visit to a shelter. The first explosion occurred on Friday morning, a day after the government ordered mandatory evacuations based on warnings from scientists who noted seismic activity before dawn on Thursday that meant magma was on the move close to the surface. An ash column burst more than 33,000ft into the sky. Lightning crackled through the still-towering cloud late on Friday. The ash forced the cancellation of flights and poor visibility limited evacuations in some areas. Officials warned that Barbados, St Lucia and Grenada could see light ashfall as the 4,003ft volcano continued to rumble. The majority of ash was expected to head north-east into the Atlantic ocean. La Soufriere had an effusive eruption in December, prompting experts from around the region to analyze the formation of a new volcanic dome and changes to its crater lake, among other things. The eastern Caribbean has 19 live volcanoes, including two underwater near the island of Grenada. One of those, Kick Em Jenny, has been active in recent years. But the most active volcano of all is Soufriere Hills in Montserrat. It has erupted continuously since 1995, razing the capital, Plymouth, and killing at least 19 people in 1997."

During New Zealands prosperous post-war period, the mass migration of Pacific Islanders was encouraged to help make up for the countrys depleted labour force. However, as work dried up during the recession of the 1970s, the community became a scapegoat for the countrys economic ills. It didnt take long for the police to realise that they had barrelled into the wrong home. Clintons father might have had brown skin, but he was a Cook Islander  all of whom have full legal status as New Zealand citizens. But instead of apologising for their intrusion, the police began abusing them. The constable turned to my mum who was white and says what are you doing with this black c-word, said Clinton, refusing to use the curse word himself. My dad was about to have a go at him. It was the Samoan officer who came in with the constable, who grabbed my dad and said, its not worth it bro, its not worth it. The intrusion was one of many during the so-called Dawn Raids, a dark affair in New Zealand history that took place from 1974 to 1976. Armed with batons, dogs, and megaphones, police would carry out government-authorised raids on the homes of Pacific Island peoples in the early hours of the morning, as they searched for overstayers to deport back to their home countries. Alongside the raids, other forms of discriminatory policing were taking place, including the policy of random checks on people in high density brown neighbourhoods. What we saw during the Dawn Raids was a massive abuse of government power. It was government-sanctioned racism and government-sanctioned terrorism, said Reverend Alec Toleafoa, one of the original members of the Polynesian Panther Party (PPP). Modelled on the United States Black Panther group, the PPP was started as a social activist organisation fighting for fairer treatment of Mori and Pasifika people in New Zealand. In 1976, the PPP conducted counter raids on politicians houses in the early hours of the morning using megaphones and bright lights, which helped end the Dawn Raids policy. We used direct action and turned their tactics back on themselves, remembers Will Ilolahia, founder of the PPP. More recently, the PPP have been leading a groundswell of support for the New Zealand government to apologise for its actions during the Dawn Raids era. We are seeking formal recognition of an era of blatant racism from the New Zealand government, so that we can be sure that it will never happen again, said Dr Melani Anae, a founding member of the PPP. Backing for the apology has come fast and strong from the Green party and younger voices like Benji Timu, who last week drafted an open letter to the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, which has seen widespread social media engagement. As a Pasifika man, I see myself as a beneficiary of the Panther movement, and so writing this letter actually came from a place of trying to make things right and rewrite our history, said Timu, the executive director of a production company focused on telling Pasifika stories. So far the government has been tight-lipped on whether they will make such an apology, releasing a statement that they are receiving advice on this and at this stage it would be inappropriate to comment further due to these ongoing discussions. Aupito William Sio, the minister for Pacific peoples, has agreed to meet with a core group of PPP members to discuss the apology, but Toleafoa suspects the government may worry that an apology would open the floodgates to other demands. To make it easy for the government, Toleafoa is keen to keep their requests simple. Were not talking about compensation, were working for something thats restorative and healing, and future-proof, he said. We want to see the compulsory teaching of the Dawn Raids and racism in our educational syllabus. Beyond better education, the loudest demand was at the heart of Timus open letter: a better pathway to residency for existing Pasifika overstayers in New Zealand. The most recent Immigration NZ research into the number of overstayers in New Zealand in 2017 shows those from Samoa and Tonga make up at least 4,000 of the more than 13,000 current overstayers. For Ilolahia, the issue is one he sees in his community every day, where Pacific Island overstayers raise families and contribute to the economy for decades, while also living in fear that theyll one day be deported. These people are paying their taxes, having kids that go on to be All Blacks, and at the same time theyre not even being recognised as New Zealanders, said Ilolahia. Timu, too, knows how hard living as an overstayer can be. When pressed on his experiences his voice becomes tight and careful, knowing that one misspoken word could put someone close at risk. I do have some family members that have been affected by that. Having to live in fear, feeling like the government doesnt really want you here, said Timu. In July last year, Illolahia and the Tongan Advisory Group presented a petition to parliament, asking for pathways to be provided for overstayers to gain permanent residency on compassionate grounds. The petition was scheduled to go before the select committee last month, but Illolahia hopes that an official apology will help spur more immediate action from the government. However the government decides to proceed, the legacy of the Dawn Raids will continue to be passed on through generations of New Zealanders. Hewett is now in his 50s, but his memory of that early morning in 1974 is as clear as day. He and Timu both share memories, decades apart, of seeing police and feeling a jolt of fear, a collective feeling of what have I done?. I think its impossible to look at the Dawn Raids as an isolated event, said Toleafoa. The same ideas, the same philosophies that created the oppressive policies way back then, theyre present today. Unless we do something now, theyll be in the future as well."

            "content": "At least seven people were killed after a 6.0 magnitude quake struck off the coast of Indonesias main Java island on Saturday, as the country reels from a cyclone disaster. The afternoon quake hit offshore about 45 kilometres south-west of Malang city in East Java, damaging hundreds of homes as well as schools, government offices and mosques across the region. Our latest data shows that seven people died, two are seriously injured and 10 others sustained minor injuries, said a disaster agency spokesman, Raditya Jati. Several communities had been evacuated, he added. The quake struck at a relatively deep 82 kilometres (50 miles)  shallower quakes tend to do more damage. Images from the scene showed a ceiling caved in at a hospital ward and debris strewn across the floor of the local parliament in Blitar, a city south-west of Malang. I had just finished praying and was changing my clothes when suddenly the quake struck, Malang resident Ida Magfiroh told AFP. It was pretty strong and went for a long time. Everything was swaying  My heart was racing. The deadly quake comes as the country reels from a cyclone that killed more than 200 people in the eastern part of the archipelago and neighbouring East Timor this week. Indonesia experiences frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions due to its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire of tectonic faultlines. In 2004 an earthquake measuring 9.1 magnitude struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 people throughout the region including about 170,000 in Indonesia. The Boxing Day disaster was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. In 2018 a powerful quake shook the island of Lombok and several more followed over the next couple of weeks, killing more than 550 people on the holiday island and neighbouring Sumbawa. Later that year a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. In 2006 a 6.3-magnitude quake rocked a densely populated region of Java near the city of Yogyakarta, killing about 6,000 people and injuring tens of thousands more. A year earlier a quake measuring 8.7 magnitude struck off the coast of Sumatra, which is particularly prone to quakes, killing 900 people and injuring about 6,000."

Dorset police said Sutton, 83, who owned a string of top hotels in London, died on Wednesday during an incident at a property near Gillingham. A woman in her 60s, named in reports as Suttons wife, was seriously injured in the incident and was airlifted to Southmead Hospital in Bristol, where she remains in a critical condition. It is believed both were stabbed, the force said. Thomas Schreiber, from the Gillingham area, has been charged with murder, attempted murder and dangerous driving and is due before magistrates in Poole on Monday. Schreiber is reported to be Suttons stepson. DI Simon Huxter, of Dorset polices major crime investigation team, said: Our thoughts remain with the victims family and all of those affected by this terrible incident. Following a detailed investigation, we have consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service. As a result, Dorset police have been authorised to formally charge Thomas Schreiber with the murder of Sir Richard, attempted murder of the injured woman and dangerous driving. Sutton was listed at number 435 in the Sunday Times rich list in 2020 with an estimated family fortune of 301 million  a rise of 83 million on the previous year. The guide says Suttons company owns London hotels the Sheraton Grand Park Lane and the Athenaeum, plus three smaller venues.

Crenshaw, who lost his right eye in 2012 during a bomb attack while he was serving in Afghanistan, said his ophthalmologist discovered that his retina was detaching in his left eye as a result of the lingering effects of his injury. He had surgery Friday after consulting with his doctor. This is a terrifying prognosis for someone with one eye, and the nature of the injuries that I sustained in Afghanistan. Anyone who knows the history of my injuries knows that I dont have a good eye, but half a good eye. The blast from 2012 caused a cataract, excessive tissue damage, and extensive damage to my retina. It was always a possibility that the effects of the damage to my retina would resurface, and it appears that is exactly what has happened, Crenshaw said in a statement. The surgery went well, but I will be effectively blind for about a month, he added. During the surgery they put a gas bubble in my eye, which acts as a bandage for my retina. This means I have to be face-down for the next week or so, unable to see anything. Crenshaw said he will not be conducting any interviews or posting on social media, other than to update the public on his medical progress, for a while. I have gotten through worse before, and I will get through this, Crenshaw said. Crenshaw first burst onto the national scene when he ran for his Houston-area seat in 2018. His physical appearance was mocked in a widely criticized joke on Saturday Night Live, after which he went on the show to bury the hatchet, drawing plaudits from members of both parties."

            "content": "Ukraine maintained Saturday that it will not back down to pressure from Russia amid increased hostilities along the border between the two countries. Ukrainian Defense Minister Andrii Taran said Russia was trying to force Kiev to cave in negotiations by ramping up its military presence on the border, but he declared that Ukraine would not let up fighting. [T]he actual goals of building up of military presence by the Russian Federation alongside the Ukrainian border and at the temporary occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, might be the increase of pressure on Ukraine for the purpose of forcing it to yield in the course of the negotiation process, Taran said in a statement Saturday. The flames of hostilities incendiated [sic] by Russia are only to be tamed in a political and diplomatic manner. Ukraine initially aims at a civilized way of returning its temporarily occupied territories. However, there should be no compromise in terms of standing for the interests of Ukraine, he added. The statement marks the latest barb in increasing tensions between Kiev and Moscow. Fighting between the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country has increased, and Russias military buildup on the border is just the latest in a string of aggressive postures. The Kremlin has threatened to breach the border, with senior Kremlin official Dmitry Kozak last week warning that Russia would be ready to defend citizens living in eastern Ukraine. Later on in his statement, Taran called on Western nations to rebuff Russias latest threats, recognizing that Ukraine alone will be too weak to combat the country's aggression. The Russian Federation is to understand that any active aggression and escalation in terms of the security environment will lead to a clear and strong response of the international community. The most convincing and effective mechanism to present the firm, sustainable and uncompromised position of the international community to Moscows officials, particularly of the European and Euro-Atlantic countries as for supporting Ukraine, Taran said. Ukraine last week announced that it will hold joint military drills with NATO troops later this year, following Russias military maneuvers. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held calls with his French and German counterparts Friday in which they discussed the importance of supporting Ukraine against unilateral Russian provocations along the Line of Contact in eastern Ukraine, in occupied Crimea, and along Ukraines borders as well as the need for Russia to immediately cease its military buildup and inflammatory rhetoric."

In a segment on Real Time with Bill Maher, the host began his commentary on the Academy Awards by saying the ceremony, which will air later this month, should change their name to the Debbies  as in Debbie Downer. Because judging by this years Best Picture nominees, you couldnt have a worse time at the movies if there was an active shooter in the theater, Maher said at the beginning of his roughly six-and-a-half minute diatribe. The host then commented on each of the eight films nominated for Best Picture, including his argument that Americans dont have to go to church. If they want to feel guilty, dirty and bad they can watch Nomadland. Thats the one where the woman winds up living in her van after her husband dies of cancer, he added. He then comments on Judas and the Black Messiah, in which the leader of the Black panthers is betrayed by an informant and killed by the FBI. Maher said that Minari is the story of dirt poor Korean immigrants in Arkansas who put all their food in a barn but then grandma has a stroke and burns it down. Now enjoy the show, he added sarcastically. I don't have to leave the theater whistling, but would it kill Hollywood to once in a while make a movie that doesn't make me want to take a bath with the toaster? We all had a rough year, a little escapism would have been appreciated. #Oscars21 #OscarNoms pic.twitter.com/UkA3zCOkbl The 2021 Oscars, brought to you by razor blades, Kleenex and rope, Maher continued. And please welcome our host, the Sad Emoji. We all had a rough year, a little escapism would have been appreciated, he argued, prompting his audience to erupt in cheers. What happened to show business? Did they all decide to quit cocaine at the same time? he jokingly questioned. Did they forget that Hollywood is still the number one place to go if youre an egomaniac looking to fill that hole from your childhood with applause? Hollywood used to know how to make a movie that was about something, a movie for adults that was also entertaining and not just depressing, Maher said. The Oscar-nominated movies, which were officially announced last month, saw politically-themed films among the top contenders, including \"The Trial of the Chicago 7,\" from \"West Wing\" creator Aaron Sorkin. The film, which has secured six total nominations, is a dramatization of the prosecution of seven activists who participated in demonstrations during the 1968 Democratic National Convention that erupted into a police riot."

            "content": "A previously undisclosed document from the Pentagon reportedly sheds light on the timeline of responses from federal government leaders on the day of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, including a call from then-Vice President Mike Pence to clear the building hours before order was actually restored. The document, prepared for internal use by the Pentagon and obtained by The Associated Press, provides insight into the level of chaos and panic among a handful of senior White House aides, leaders of Congress and the vice president, who were all tasked with managing responses to the mob attack amid former President Trumps inaction. According to the AP, the timeline shows that shortly after 4 p.m., two hours after rioters broke into the Capitol and as they continued to roam the building, Pence made a phone call from a secure room to then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. The document states that Pence told Miller the Capitol was not secure and demanded a deadline from military leaders on when they would be able to restore order. Information obtained by the AP indicated that Trump in a Jan. 3 Cabinet meeting approved the activation of the Washington, D.C., National Guard and told Miller to take any necessary action at the Stop the Steal rally events. However, the Guards role was restricted to traffic sections and checkpoints around D.C., with the Trump administration and Pentagon officials hesitant to display a heavy military presence following criticism over responses to civil unrest in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. On Jan. 6, as rioters began to approach the Capitol, then-Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund called Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, to request assistance. As the rioters later entered the building, Sund called Walker again asking for at least 200 Guard members and to send more if they are available. Shortly after 3 p.m., Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy gave verbal approval of the activation of 1,100 National Guard troops to support the D.C. police. Minutes later, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) were calling the Pentagon for additional support, they were informed that additional Guard members had been approved. However, the AP noted that the Guard had prepared troops only for traffic duties, and law enforcement leaders spent roughly 90 minutes coordinating response plans and handing troops the necessary gear. Later in the afternoon, Pelosi and Schumer participated in a 30-minute call with military leaders and at one point accused the National Security apparatus of knowing that protestors planned to conduct an assault on the Capitol, the Pentagons timeline reportedly says. A Pentagon spokesperson said they were \"not sure\" which document the AP was referring to, but that the response of the National Guard was based on a request from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). \"I can tell you the preparation and posture of the DC National Guard was based on the single request for assistance the Pentagon received from the DC Mayor for limited support, primarily for street closures and crowd control involving 340 DCNG at various locations around the District to facilitate and protect peaceful demonstrations,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hill. The new timeline comes after the Capitol Polices Office of Inspector General said in a report obtained by CNN on Thursday that officers were supplied with aging equipment and failed to follow up on additional intelligence ahead of the Jan. 6 attack. Thursdays report was the second from the inspector generals office slamming \"deficiencies\" in the agencys handling of intelligence leading up to the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol after issuing a similar report last week.

            "content": "The feud between Republicans and major corporations over voting laws is creating an opportunity for Democrats and President Biden to build new political ties. GOP ties with big business frayed during the Trump era, when corporations sometimes found themselves at the end of then-President Trumps barbs, and were often uncomfortable with his rhetoric about women, minorities and immigrants. Now the tensions are rising again as companies speak out against Georgias voting law, and Major League Baseball pulls its All-Star Game from Atlanta in protest. Democrats are seeing an opportunity to build inroads with business, despite real differences over some policies. The business community trusts us because we are bringing stability and reliability to a process that has been incredibly chaotic for the last four years, said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), chairman of the moderate, pro-business Democrats NewDem Action Fund. Differences between the White House and Democrats and business arent hard to find. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers are among the groups opposed to raising the corporate tax rate, a key provision in Bidens infrastructure proposal. The battle over the infrastructure bill in some ways is a return to the past, when business groups were reliable allies of Republicans. Its absolutely the wrong time to impose new burdens on the private sector, GOP fundraiser Dan Eberhart said in a recent interview. Hes taking investment decisions away from the private sector and handing control to government. Yet the divisions between business and the GOP are growing, despite their alignment on some traditional issues. As Trumps brand of populism has sprouted within the GOP, it has created new tensions with business over issues such as trade. Moderate Democrats in Congress want to take advantage of those tensions and paint themselves as the steady party for business to work with. Democrats should try to be the good governing party. I think theres a lot of demand for that from the public and business. Democrats ... should consider themselves the party that can work with business. That doesnt mean you can always agree on everything, so there is still that tension point on various issues that will happen over time, said Daniella Ballou-Aares, who worked in the Obama State Department. Democrats are optimistic Biden can deliver wins for the business community like the COVID-19 relief package, which business leaders embraced although it received no Republican support. It would be a missed opportunity for business and for Biden not to work towards successful legislation. ... Were so at that moment and I think it would be a shame if that moment is allowed to pass by on either side, Ballou-Aares said. The other big dividing line for business and the GOP, magnified by Trump, was on issues of race. A number of CEOs spoke out against Trump when he said both sides were to blame in Charlottesville, Va., after white supremacists and Nazis battled counterprotesters in August 2017. The fight over Georgias voting law revolves around corporations wanting to distance themselves from any effort seen as preventing minority groups from voting  particularly after Trumps unsubstantiated allegations just months ago that widespread fraud led to his electoral loss. Misinformation surrounding the election culminated in an angry mob attacking the Capitol. Republicans argue the true nature of the Georgia voting law has been misstated by Democrats and the media, and that corporations are essentially turning on them in favor of a new woke culture. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) cautioned corporations to \"stay out of politics\" as multiple companies expressed their opposition to the new Georgia voting law. And dont be intimidated by the left into taking up causes that put you right in the middle of one of Americas greatest political debates, he said Monday. Its hard to see Democrats and big business forming a true lasting partnership. Progressives in Congress are deeply critical of corporate America, which is increasingly a target for populists in both parties. Liberals have pressured Biden to distance himself from Wall Street, launching campaigns even against some would-be Biden nominees deemed to have corporate ties. Yet Trump has also left a real opening for Democrats. Dozens of companies responded to the Capitol riot by freezing donations to the 147 Republicans who voted to overturn the election results after the mob was turned out of the halls of Congress. Trump has also continued to be an antagonist, calling for his supporters to boycott Coca-Cola and other companies that have expressed concerns about the new Georgia voting law. A former senior official in the Trump Commerce Department said if Democrats and the White House can solidify the relationship with business, it could help them in the 2022 elections. If the Biden team can reassure business that they will always have a seat at the table, they could really leverage a historic break with their natural allies in the GOP and change the landscape of these many suburban races, the former official said."

            "content": "As President Biden races ahead with a mammoth plan to bolster the nation's infrastructure, Democrats are gambling they'll get a political boost from an accompanying proposal: the tax hikes designed to defray the massive costs. Biden on Wednesday outlined a slate of tax reforms aimed at raising $2.5 trillion  much of it from large corporations  to underwrite the new infrastructure spending. The proposal was quickly roasted by Republicans, who have long portrayed Democrats as the party of higher taxes and are now warning that Biden's plan would hurt small businesses and kill American jobs. Yet national polls have consistently revealed that tax hikes on corporations and other wealthy taxpayers enjoy strong support among a broad array of voters, including independents. And some Democrats are practically drooling at the prospect of bringing that debate to the national stage to highlight the GOP's resistance to a popular concept. If they fight the infrastructure bill over asking corporations to pay more in taxes, that's a total loser, Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), chairman of the Budget Committee, said this week in a phone interview. It's just sort of a nonsense argument, and I think that's an indication of how vulnerable the Republicans are on this issue, he added. The issue sets up perfectly for those, like us, who are promoting significant investment in infrastructure and saying to major corporations, Since your businesses depend on infrastructure, you can do more to pay for it. \" The idea is hardly new. Democrats have sought for decades to close tax-avoidance loopholes enjoyed by corporations and other wealthy taxpayers, largely to no avail. And Republicans in 2017 were able to expand those benefits as part of former President Trumps tax overhaul, which included a reduction in the corporate rate from 35 to 21 percent. But after a year of turmoil caused by the coronavirus crisis  when stocks soared but millions of low-income workers lost their jobs  Democrats think the uneven economic impact of the pandemic has shifted public opinion enough in their favor to make the controversial tax hikes a political asset. Indeed, a new Morning Consult/Politico survey found that 54 percent of voters support sweeping infrastructure improvements financed by tax hikes, including 73 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of independents. When the biggest corporations evade taxes, or pay a net rate on the average of something like 7 or 8 percent, smaller businesses and individuals have to make up the difference, Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), a senior member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, told The Hill. So I think that, as much as it is about pay-fors, it's also about tax fairness. As ammunition, Democrats are pointing to a recent report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank, which found that 55 of the nations largest corporations  including Nike, FedEx and Salesforce  paid no federal taxes in 2020 despite enormous pre-tax profits. In some cases, the companies received a substantial federal rebate. The report was reminiscent of last years revelation that Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire, had paid only $750 in federal income tax in both 2016 and 2017. Both reports have infuriated Democrats who are vowing to create a fairer system  and all but daring Republicans to defend tax loopholes that favor the wealthy. Freeways arent free. And corporate freeloaders  like the 55 large profitable corporations who paid no federal income tax in 2020  should pay for the infrastructure and other services upon which they depend, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), another senior member of the Ways and Means panel, said in an email. Unveiled Wednesday, Biden's tax plan features a series of reforms designed to compel large corporations and businesses to contribute a larger share of earnings to the federal government. It does so largely by hiking the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent; prohibiting companies from shifting profits to low-tax havens overseas; and creating a new 15-percent minimum tax on large companies that report profits to investors, but no liabilities to the IRS. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen briefed House Democrats on the proposal on Tuesday. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that Democrats are hoping to move the entire package  infrastructure and tax provisions alike  through Congress and to Biden's desk by August. The president is open to policy suggestions from lawmakers in both parties, Pelosi said. But it can't be too small, she added, because what we're talking about now needs to be transformative and it has to be big. Democratic leaders are seeking a delicate balance. While liberals in the party are supportive of massive new infrastructure spending  even pressing Biden to go bigger than his $2 trillion proposal  the partys moderates are wary of both the size of the package and the effects on deficit spending. Does it really have to be a $2 trillion package at this moment? I don't think that we should concede that, said an aide to a centrist Democrat in the House. At the very least, we should try to pay for as much of this as possible. They can afford few defections. Pelosi has just a razor-thin majority in the House, made even thinner by the recent death of Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.). And the split is an even 50-50 in the Senate, where Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate West Virginia Democrat, is already flexing his outsized influence in opposing Bidens plan to raise the corporate rate to 28 percent. Those internal frictions have not been overlooked by Republicans, who are fighting to make the tax package as uncomfortable as possible for centrist Democrats in tough battleground districts. With that in mind, the Republicans this week are highlighting another report, sponsored by the National Association of Manufacturers, predicting that an increase in the corporate rate to 28 percent  combined with the elimination of several other corporate benefits  would cost the country 1 million jobs in just two years. And the Republicans' campaign arm has pounced, launching a broad-based email campaign linking vulnerable Democrats across the country to the threat of heightened unemployment sparked by Biden's proposal. No president has ever raised business taxes to rebuild an economy, Rep. Kevin Brady (Texas), senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, told CNBC this week. At the end of the day, we're going to see slower hiring, [and] we're going to see less investment in the U.S. Democrats remain undaunted. Infrastructure was among just three named policy priorities they'd championed on the campaign trail in 2018, when they won control of the House. And after COVID-19 relief, it remains the top domestic priority of Biden, who's already using the bully pulpit in an effort to sell his plan to the public at large. If the early debate is any indication, the Democrats' pitch is going to lean heavily on the concept of fairness. You've got Amazon  whose entire business is built on having adequate infrastructure  and they paid 1.2 percent last year and zero [percent] the two years before that. And they made $30 billion, said Yarmuth. That's not fair in anybody's book."

Officers give the homeless trash bags and stop by every two weeks to pick them up. A homeless person can earn up to a $20 grocery store gift card if they have their trash bag filled up. The gift card allows them to buy anything at a grocery store besides alcohol and cigarettes. Bontrager said many of the homeless are using the gift cards for food and hygiene products. The program is also saving the city thousands of dollars. Wed go there, it would just be a massive mess, wed spend hours just cleaning and cleaning, but now we go there and their bags are ready, Elk Grove Police Department Homeless Outreach Officer Jennifer McCue said. Bontrager said the homeless are grateful to be able to go to the store to pick out what they want and for the opportunity to make money while cleaning up the city. Just because Im homeless doesnt mean I dont care, Ashley Ross, a homeless resident in the city, told the local outlet."

Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and husband to Queen Elizabeth II, died on Friday at the age of 99. Buckingham Palace announced that the prince died peacefully at Windsor Castle, where he and the queen have spent much of the last year during the pandemic. Philip reportedly did not want the fuss of a state funeral at Westminster Hall, according to The Times of London. His body is expected to lie in St. James Palace. Johnson honored Philip after the news of the Duke of Edinburghs death, saying that he \"earned the affection of generations here in Britain, across the Commonwealth and around the world.\" The prime minister said that the royal family lost not just a much loved and highly respected public figure, but a devoted husband, a proud and loving father, grandfather, and in recent years, great grandfather. The Conservative Party in the United Kingdom also announced that it is suspending national campaigning until Tuesday and again next Saturday, the day of Philips funeral, according to multiple reports.

There has been a 38.9 percent decline rate, but the Marines are providing information to individuals to encourage them to get the vaccine. The Navy and Marine Corps are providing substantial educational information broadly, and working with commands to ensure Marines, Sailors, and beneficiaries have accurate information regarding the safety and efficacy of the vaccines to encourage individuals to get immunized, Capt. Andrew Wood, a Marines spokesman, told The Hill in a statement. The data showed that 75,500 Marines have received the vaccine and 48,000 have declined it. Overall, the acceptance rate is 61.1 percent. The numbers for the data include reserves, active-duty and Individual Mobilization Augmentee Marines, according to CNN. Wood said the Marines mostly include young and healthy individuals and that there are multiple reasons they might decline the vaccine. For example, an individual may have deferred until later to allow others to get the vaccine, they may have gotten the vaccine on their own and not through military channels, they could be unavailable for a second dose in the prescribed time period for the vaccines that require two doses, they could expect the vaccine to become mandatory and are waiting until then, or they may be allergic to one of the compounds in the vaccine, Wood said. The military previously estimated that 66 percent would accept the coronavirus vaccine, according to CNN. Wood said any individual who originally declined the vaccine can change their mind and receive it. We continue to make the vaccine available to Marines, Sailors, civilians, contractors and authorized beneficiaries based on the prioritization schedule listed in the [Department of Defense] population schema, Wood said. Since the vaccines have only emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, the military can not require that service members get vaccinated. Camp Lejeune in North Carolina saw a 57 percent decline rate for the vaccine, the data showed. We fully understand that widespread acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine provides us with the best means to defeat this pandemic, Wood said."

            "content": "The editorial board of Florida-based newspaper The Palm Beach Post on Friday blasted Gov. Ron DeSantiss (R) executive order banning COVID-19 \"vaccine passports.\" The editorial comes as several governors in recent weeks have taken actions to limit vaccine passports  documents that provide proof of vaccination to give people access to events with larger crowds such as weddings and parties. DeSantis issued an executive order in early April preventing government entities and private businesses from requiring proof of vaccination. He has argued that doing so infringes on individual freedom. The governor's argument makes no sense. The issue before us is one of public health. And there is no question that vaccinations are the most effective weapon against COVID-19 yet devised, the board wrote. By preventing Floridians to distinguish between who is vaccinated and who is not, DeSantis is telling us to be content with prolonging the pandemic. The board noted that entities such as the cruise industry, sports leagues, theme parks and conventions might challenge the order. It further stated that DeSantis's argument was \"puzzling,\" noting that it goes against the premise of his entire COVID-19 response to date. \"The governors entire COVID-19 response has been based on the idea that its best to trust people to do the right thing without the government telling them what to do,\" it wrote. \"Not here. Suddenly, DeSantis isnt content to forbid government from demanding a 'vaccine passport.' He doesnt want businesses to make that decision for themselves, either,\" it continued. The newspaper said that it would have understood barring state and local governments form requiring proof of vaccination but not private businesses. If DeSantis had merely forbidden Floridas state and local governments from issuing vaccination passports, we would have understood, though perhaps not agreed, the board wrote. But DeSantis' decision also forbidding private entities from requiring proof of inoculation is just bizarre, and goes way too far. The Hill has reached out to DeSantis for comment. Conservatives have argued that vaccine passports infringe on peoples right to privacy and choice of whether to get vaccinated. The debate over the documents has catapulted to the national level, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki saying Tuesday that the federal government will not \"be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential. There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.\""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 179 million doses of vaccine have been administered in the U.S. as of Saturday afternoon. However, Fauci said Americans should not yet claim victory over the virus as case counts surge in several states. Michigan in particular has seen a spike in cases, with the coronavirus ripping through workplaces, churches and other public areas, according to The New York Times. \"It's kind of a race between the vaccine and the possibility that there'll be another surge,\" Fauci said. Fauci said 70 to 85 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity, which could happen by June if the U.S. continues to administer an average of 3 million vaccines per day, Business Insider reported. \"If we could just hold on for a while,\" he told Business Insider, \"we'll reach a point where the protection of the general community by the vaccine would really make it very unlikely that we're going to have another surge.\" Although Fauci is not going to indoor spaces or traveling, he is allowing neighbors who are vaccinated into his home without masks. \"We feel very comfortable in the house with no masks, and we can have physical contact and things like that,\" Fauci said. Fauci said his cautious lifestyle could be due to how busy he is as well. \"To be honest with you, I don't really have time to do anything else,\" he said. \"I haven't gotten the day off in a year and three months. The CDC has put out guidelines for vaccinated people, stating that they can travel domestically without having to quarantine and can meet with other vaccinated people without masks."

Democrats indicated they will most likely split up Bidens infrastructure plan into two separate bills, though the overall plan will include funding for projects like roads, bridges and public transit as well as child care, elder care and family tax credits. The first portion, which has a price tag of roughly $2.25 trillion, has already faced opposition from Republicans, who say the package is too expensive and contorts the parameters of what infrastructure plans are supposed to cover. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said last weekend that Biden should cut the package down to about $615 billion in order to get it passed. However, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said this week that she plans on both packages being passed by August and that Democrats may opt to pass them via budget reconciliation, which would allow the party to avoid the Senates 60-vote filibuster. \"I think we will have two bills,\" she told reporters on a Thursday press call. \"We're hoping that we can do  especially [the] infrastructure bill  with [bipartisan support]. ... If we have to go to reconciliation, that's a lever, but I hope it's not something that we'll need to do.\" Pelosi will appear on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" this Sunday. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, another key player in Biden's infrastructure plan, will appear on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" However, Biden has expressed openness to changing some aspects of his plan to win over some GOP votes. Compromise is inevitable, changes are certain, Biden said in remarks from the White House this week. Well be open to good ideas and good faith negotiations. But heres what we wont be open to. We will not be open to doing nothing. Inaction simply is not an option. Meanwhile, an alarming surge in coronavirus cases in Michigan has forced the White House to determine if it should send additional vaccines there. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-Mich.) has advocated for Michigan to be a priority and get more shots, though the White House has thus far denied her request. There are tens of millions of people across the country in each and every state and county who have not yet been vaccinated, Jeff Zients, the White House coordinator for the COVID-19 response said this week. And the fair and equitable way to distribute the vaccine is based on the adult population by state, tribe and territory. That's how it's been done, and we will continue to do so. The virus is unpredictable, he added. We don't know where the next increase in cases could occur. Whitmer will appear on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday as well. Below is the full roster of guests for this Sundays talk shows.  Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm; Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).  Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Pelosi; Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.); Whitmer; Tony Thurmond, California's superintendent of public instruction.  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg; Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.); Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.).

You can go f-ck yourself, he continued. Reid on Saturday responded to the excerpt, telling CNNs Jim Acosta that, The deal is this: John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didnt mince words. He was right. I did everything I could to cause him trouble because I knew he was having a lot of trouble. The more trouble he had in his caucus, the better it was for us, and he knew what I was doing, and I wasnt at all surprised that he came to me and gave me one of his underhanded blessings, Reid said. The former Nevada lawmaker recalled that he and Boehner would always meet in Boehners office because I didnt want anyone smoking in my office, joking that he could then smoke to his hearts content. I have a lot of respect for John Boehner. He, as far as Im concerned, was a great patriot, Reid told CNN. Boehner in the book, which is set to be released this week, does pulls no punches about his time in the nations capital, going so far as to criticize several fellow Republicans, including former President Trump, Sens.

The New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) said in a statement it arrested Stanley Warnick and Kathryn Diionno in connection to the incident, CNN reported. Along with the arrests, the chair dedicated to Davis was also recovered Thursday. Diionno and Warnick are being charged with possession of stolen property in New Orleans, but are already out on bail, the police statement says. The police are also looking for another person they believe was involved in the theft. The Dallas County Sheriff's Office in Alabama asked the NOPD for help with the investigation after the chair was stolen from the Old Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Ala., in March. \"They are small business owners and community members. They are, if anything, themselves victims of mistakes of fact that have led to this unfortunate situation,\" attorneys Michael Kennedy and Miles Swanson told CNN. \"They look forward to clearing their names and disassociating their names from any criminal activity.\" A group calling itself \"White Lies Matter\" previously took responsibility for the stolen chair, which is worth $500,000. The group said it would not give the chair back unless the United Daughters of the Confederacy were allowed to hang a big banner outside their headquarters with a quote from a Black Liberation Army activist wanted for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper in 1973. White Lies Matter threatened that failure to meet their demands would result in the monument, an ornate stone chair, immediately being turned into a toilet.

Its minority-owned businesses that have been hit harder than most because of an invisible virus by no fault of their own, Kemp said at a restaurant in Atlanta, The Associated Press reported. The restaurant is near Truist Park, where the All-Star game had initially been slated to take place. And these are the same minority businesses that are now being impacted by another decision that is by no fault of their own, he added. The MLB moved the game to Denver, Colo., on Tuesday in protest of a new voting law in Georgia that Democrats and critics say amounts to voter suppression and targets communities of color in particular. Kemp signed the legislation into law late last month behind closed doors. The new law tightens restrictions on ballot drop boxes, sets ID requirements for absentee voting and makes it a crime for people to hand out water or food to individuals standing in line. However, Kemp said people shouldn't have to worry about politics when they're at a baseball game. People shouldnt have to go to the game and worry about if theyre sitting next to a Joe Biden supporter or a Donald Trump supporter, Brian said Saturday. They ought to be able to go to the game, cheer for their team just like if youre in church worshipping. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, urged the MLB not to move the game from the state for fear of loss of jobs. \"As I have stated, I respect boycotts, although I dont want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs,\" Abrams said. \"Georgians targeted by voter suppression will be hurt as opportunities go to other states.\" Kemp has previously defended the law and said that it is worth the boycotts against his state. Free and fair elections are the foundation of who we are as a state and a nation. Secure, accessible, fair elections are worth the threats.

            "content": "Maryland on Saturday became the first state in the nation to repeal its Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights after Democrats in the state legislature overrode Gov. Larry Hogans (R) veto of the police accountability legislation. Hogan on Friday night vetoed a slate of criminal justice reform bills that the General Assembly had passed on Wednesday. But Democrats hold a veto-proof majority in each chamber of the state legislature and had said the vetoes would be scrapped after they vowed to implement new law enforcement accountability measures following a string of high-profile police killings of unarmed Black men, including George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The passage of the bills does away with the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, which provided police protections, including the removal of complaints after a certain amount of time had passed and a five-day waiting period for officers who were accused of misconduct to speak to internal investigators. The protections will now be replaced with a new procedure for handing down punishments for officers accused of wrongdoing. That process will be conducted jointly between police departments and civilians. The bills also implement a new statewide use-of-force policy, which, among other things, criminalizes the excessive use of force, mandates body camera use and restricts the use of no-knock warrants. Two other bills that passed after Hogan did not veto them allow the Baltimore Police Department to be controlled by civilians and permit an independent entity to investigate police-involved fatalities. Republicans had come out swinging against the Democratic measures, saying they undermined efforts to restore trust between police officers and the communities they monitor. These bills would undermine the goal that I believe we share of building transparent, accountable, and effective law enforcement institutions and instead further erode police morale, community relationships, and public confidence. They will result in great damage to police recruitment and retention, posing significant risks to public safety throughout our state, Hogan wrote in his veto letter. Every profession must be accountable to the people that we serve. Every profession has rules. Every profession desires to continue to be respected by the members of the public that they and we serve, said state Sen. Arthur Ellis (D). Police officers have a unique obligation to protect and serve."

            "content": "A bill up for final approval by the Washington state Senate aims to provide attorneys for some low-income residents facing eviction, which would make it the first state to enact such a measure. The bill, a draft of which was initially passed in the state Senate and was approved with amendments by the House on Thursday, would provide lawyers for tenants who meet certain qualifying conditions. Those eligible to receive legal representation from the state include residents receiving certain public assistance, individuals who have been committed to a mental health facility, those who cant afford an attorney or those who have incomes at 125 percent or below the federal poverty level, according to The Seattle Times. Jim Bamberger, director of the states Office of Civil Legal Aid, praised the legislation, telling the Times that it is a powerful statement on the part of the legislature in terms of balancing power in the justice system between tenants and landlords. And I think it will work, honestly, in favor of both, he added. However, an amendment added to the bill Thursday night has prompted concern from housing advocates, as it would end Washington states eviction moratorium on June 30, the same day the federal order halting the practice amid the pandemic is set to expire. Bamberger told the Times that if passed, the bill would require his office to hire 58 additional state attorneys, which he said may not be logistically possible in less than three months. However, some state lawmakers have pointed out that the amendment would temporarily require the state to provide rental assistance directly to a persons landlord if a program qualified tenant does not have access to a lawyer starting July 1. The argument that the day the moratorium ends people are going to be on the street is just false, state Rep. Andrew Barkis (R) told the Times. It takes months to go through the eviction process. We believe there will be plenty of time for these things to get set up, he added. Bamberger noted that the legal representation program will likely cost his office an estimated $11.4 million in the first year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced late last month, three days before the existing federal eviction moratorium was set to expire, that it would be extending the temporary ban on coronavirus-related evictions through the end of June. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement at the time, The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a historic threat to the nations public health. Keeping people in their homes and out of crowded or congregate settings  like homeless shelters  by preventing evictions is a key step in helping to stop the spread of COVID-19. However, concerns have erupted in recent days after a new guidance issued by a Texas judicial advisory panel gave the green light for state courts to openly defy the CDC moratorium, putting hundreds of thousands of Texans at risk of being removed from their homes."

Emergent Biosolutions CEO Robert Kramer received $5.6 million in 2020, according to a public filing reviewed by the Post on Friday. The company executive received an $893,000 salary, $1.4 million from stock options, $2.1 million from stock award and a $1.2 million bonus, according to the Post. According to the filing, the company increased Kramer's pay after the companys manufacturing business expanded and the CEO responded to the pandemic. The company also reported a 41 percent increase in revenue in 2020. Kramer rose to CEO of the company in 2019, and has been with the company since 2012, according to the paper. Emergent saw that increase in growth last year mainly due to a federal contract that gave the company $628 million to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, according to the newspaper. The Post noted however that the bonuses came before the company's Maryland plant contaminated 15 million Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses. At the end of March, the issues surrounding vaccine production at the Emergent plant became public after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was contaminated with ingredients from the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to the Post. AstraZeneca materials have been completely moved from the facility and Johnson & Johnson is taking charge of the oversight for the plant. The White House warned Friday that states will receive a substantially lower amount of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine over the coming weeks as a result of the mishap. The New York Times earlier this week reported that there was a high risk for cross-contamination found in audits of the facility last year. The staff was also reported to be undertrained.

            "content": "The Biden administration is taking initial steps toward an expanded role in global COVID-19 vaccination efforts, while stopping short of sharing excess doses on a wide scale. The federal government has been amassing doses, growing its supply into what will likely become a surplus as the rest of the world struggles with shortages. In fact, the U.S. has purchased enough vaccines to immunize every adult in the country three times over. Aid groups now say it's past time to start giving away the surplus. The administration, however, remains hesitant to do so. The U.S. vaccination campaign has been relatively successful to date, averaging close to 3 million shots administered every day. About a quarter of all adults have been fully vaccinated, and the Biden administration is well on its way to achieving its goal of inoculating 200 million people by the end of April. But most of the U.S. international support has come in the form of money, with the administration committing $4 billion to the World Health organization-backed COVAX vaccine initiative. The U.S. is also co-hosting a fundraising campaign for COVAX in the coming days, with the aim of calling on wealthy nations to join the United States and others in providing resources and commitments to accelerate global COVID-19 vaccinations. In recent days, top financial and diplomatic officials have indicated they are thinking about next steps, and how to balance the humanitarian needs and possible political implications of vaccine diplomacy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday said he has been hearing the calls to share doses. \"I know that many countries are asking for the United States to do more, some with growing desperation because of the scope and scale of their COVID emergencies. We hear you. And I promise, were moving as fast as possible,\" Blinken said. In response to those calls, he announced the appointment of Gayle Smith as U.S. coordinator for global COVID-19 response and health security. Smith most recently served as president and CEO of the ONE Campaign, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for ending poverty and preventable disease by 2030. The ONE Campaign has been pressuring the administration to ship some of its vaccine supply to developing countries. Late last month, the group joined a coalition of 30 nongovernmental organizations in sending a letter to Biden, urging him to immediately begin to develop a plan to share excess vaccine doses. It is estimated that there could be twice as many deaths from COVID-19 if rich countries monopolize the first doses of vaccines instead of making sure they are distributed globally, the groups wrote. The hope for advocates is that Smith, who helped lead the Obama administrations response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, will play a pivotal role in designing such a program. In a dig at Russia and China, which have been more than willing to donate vaccines as a way to foster friendly relations, Blinken noted that when the time comes for the U.S. to send doses overseas, the nation \"wont trade shots in arms for political favors. This is about saving lives.\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently spoke about the role wealthy countries need to play in helping to end the pandemic. During a speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Yellen warned that the economic toll of the pandemic will push 150 million people into extreme poverty this year without a substantial increase in support for developing countries. Our first task must clearly be stopping the virus by ensuring that vaccinations, testing and therapeutics are available as widely as possible,\" she said. President Biden has so far only committed to providing about 4 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which is not yet authorized in the U.S., to Mexico and Canada. \"The president remains committed to playing a constructive role in the global effort to defeat the virus,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. \"But as we've seen, this is an unpredictable virus and his first priority is ensuring the American people are vaccinated, and that means we need to plan for supply.\" Psaki said the administration is planning for contingencies, and cited the recent error at a manufacturing plant producing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that resulted in 15 million ruined doses. She also said the U.S. needs to plan for vaccinating children and the potential need for booster shots. Tom Kenyon chief health officer at Project HOPE, a global health organization, said the appointment of Smith, and the remarks by Yellen and Blinken, is a sign the administration will eventually move to start sharing vaccines. But I think we have to move beyond the promise, to action,\" Kenyon said. \"This is a pandemic, and it's an emergency.\" Kenyon said the U.S. should have already been sending surplus supplies to help other countries protect their health workers. \"This is a public health endeavor, not a diplomatic endeavor alone. We need diplomacy, but we need public health action,\" Kenyon said."

Hogan on Friday announced that former U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur will chair the group, which will craft strategies, recommendations and actions to address the rise in anti-Asian violence. The body will be the first of its kind in the U.S. and comes after a shooting last month at Atlanta-area spas killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent. This workgroup, one of the first of its kind in the country, will be composed of a wide ranging group of experts and advocates across various disciplines who will be tasked with developing recommendations, strategies, and additional actions that can be taken to address this rise in anti-Asian activity, to prevent acts of violence, and to support victims and witnesses, Hogan said. Rob Hur is a strong advocate for justice and for the Asian American community. I want to thank him for all his many years of service to the State of Maryland and to the nation, and we very much appreciate his willingness to share his significant expertise, knowledge, and leadership by spearheading this important effort,\" he added. Calls to address anti-Asian discrimination rose to a boiling point after the Atlanta shooting, with many advocating for the attack to be labeled a hate crime. Hogan said crimes against Asian Americans rose by nearly 150 percent nationally in 2020 and had more than doubled since 2018. Hur will supervise the selection of members of the workgroup in cooperation with the governors office and relevant stakeholders. Those members will be introduced in the coming weeks. As an Asian American, Im grateful to Governor Hogan and the First Lady for focusing attention on the important issues of bias and violence against members of Asian American communities in our nation, and Im thankful for the opportunity to be part of the solution, Hur said. Conversations about subjects like race and racism can be extraordinarily awkward and difficult,\" he continued. \"But awkward and difficult and honest conversations are the only way to solve big and painful problems in our society. Hogan, whose wife, daughters and grandchildren are Asian, has been an outspoken advocate in support of the Asian-American community since the Atlanta shooting. It really has been a serious problem. My wife, my three daughters, my grandkids, all Asian, and ... they've felt some discrimination personally,\" Hogan said last month. We will not stay silent anymore. But we will also not respond with vengeance. Instead, we will love each other more, we will support each other more, and we will stand together. We will make sure the overwhelming outpouring of support from leaders turns into real and lasting action that protects our children and grandchildren, Maryland first lady Yumi Hogan added in an op-ed in March advocating for new hate crime legislation."

A witness told Reuters that there was rumbling from the volcano and ash coming out of it Saturday morning. It is possible for larger explosions to occur following the one that took place Friday, according to the wire service, and they may go on for weeks or months. COVID-19 has complicated evacuations amid the eruptions, as the surrounding islands that agreed to host evacuees, including St. Lucia, Grenada and Barbados, still have restrictions in place, The New York Times reported. A Royal Caribbean cruise ship heading to the island to help evacuate people requires passengers to be vaccinated before boarding, and surrounding islands willing to take refugees require coronavirus vaccinations, Gonsalves said. Even shelters on the island are limiting those who can come in and recommend a vaccine, the prime minister added. St. Vincents National Emergency Management Organisation released a statement on Saturday telling residents to be ready to evacuate at short notice as steaming/smoking has increased.

            "content": "The court rules that Bible study groups should be able to gather in private homes if commercial spaces are open. The Supreme Court blocked Californias Covid-19 restrictions on religious gatherings in private homes in a late-night order on Friday, saying that the law infringes on constitutionally protectedreligious rights in a 5-4 vote. The decision, in which Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the three dissenting liberal justices, marks the fifth time that the Supreme Court has sided with religious adherents protesting Californias laws designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. And it underscores how Justice Amy Coney Barretts replacement of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in November has tilted the high court toward overruling state Covid-19 restrictions on religious services. The unsigned majority opinion argued that Californias law  which limits both religious and non-religious gatherings in homes to no more than three households  treats religious gatherings unfairly in light of allowances for gatherings in commercial spaces. California treats some comparable secular activities more favorably than at-home religious exercise, permitting hair salons, retail stores, personal care services, movie theaters, private suites at sporting events and concerts and indoor restaurants, the opinion said. But in her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, wrote that the majority opinion was making the wrong comparison between unlike activities: The First Amendment requires that a state treat religious conduct as well as the state treats comparable secular conduct. Sometimes finding the right secular analogue may raise hard questions. But not today. Voxs German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administrations unprecedented burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. In her dissent, Kagan explained that Californias law doesnt single out religious gatherings but simply treats all at-home gatherings differently than commercial spaces. California limits religious gatherings in homes to three households. If the state also limits all secular gatherings in homes to three households, it has complied with the First Amendment. And the state does exactly that: It has adopted a blanket restriction on at-home gatherings of all kinds, religious and secular alike, she wrote. The reason for the restrictions on households that dont apply to commercial spaces, she wrote, is that gatherings in private homes are considered categorically riskier because of the more intimate way people gather in them. That argument was in line with the majority opinion from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that the Supreme Court ultimately rejected. In that opinion, judges Milan Smith Jr. and Bridget Bade wrote that it made sense for California law to treat commercial and non-commercial spaces differently: The state reasonably concluded that when people gather in social settings, their interactions are likely to be longer than they would be in a commercial setting; that participants in a social gathering are more likely to be involved in prolonged conversations; that private houses are typically smaller and less ventilated than commercial establishments; and that social distancing and mask-wearing are less likely in private settings and enforcement is more difficult. The case that prompted the decision was brought by two Santa Clara County residents who said that Covid-19 restrictions violated their free speech rights by preventing their Bible study and prayer sessions with eight to 12 individuals. The Supreme Courts decision in their favor is a reminder of how Barretts arrival has shifted the ideological makeup of the court, and its outlook on clashes between states and advocates for minimizing Covid-19 state restrictions on religious gatherings. As legal analyst Adam Liptak notes at the New York Times, before Ginsburgs death last year, the Supreme Court allowed California and Nevada to restrict religious service attendance, and Roberts, the chief justice, was siding with what was then a liberal contingent made up of four justices. But that pattern shifted after Barretts arrival last fall, and the Supreme Court blocked New Yorks restrictions on religious services. Conservative activists rankled by Covid-19 restrictions hailed Fridays Supreme Court ruling as a victory for the right and for freedom to worship. That the state of California thinks it should be able to regulate who can pray together inside private homes is almost as appalling as the desire of all the brainwashed Fauci worshipping sheep for more arbitrary authoritarian COVID rules to keep them safe https://t.co/55fy62CyHc Meanwhile, commentators on the left have said the issue at hand is not religious liberty but rather an emerging culture war over the status of religion in American life. In a New Republic piece about the trend of the new conservative majoritys rulings on Covid-19 and religion, Katherine Stewart writes that the Supreme Courts recent legal interventions are designed to validate a false underlying narrative of religious persecution in America.

            "content": "Gov. Gretchen Whitmers actions fly in the face of mandatory restrictions she instituted last year. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is declining to order state-wide lockdowns in response to her state experiencing the most severe Covid-19 outbreak in the country, opting instead to recommend that people take personal responsibility and voluntarily take a break from spaces where transmission is more likely. The decision to refrain from instituting mandatory restrictions is a striking development for a Democratic governor who last year garnered national attention for swiftly instituting and standing by social distancing laws even in the face of militant right-wing protests and a kidnapping attempt against her. This time around, even as her state is experiencing a full-blown crisis, shes taking a softer approach in what may be a political calculation about her reelection prospects next year. Michigan has recently become the newest coronavirus epicenter of the US. Case rates have risen 375 percent since late February, and Michigan is home to 16 of the 20 metro areas with the nations highest recent number of cases. Sixteen Michigan hospitals are operating at over 90 percent capacity. Experts say that the surge is due to a combination of the enhanced contagiousness of the B.1.1.7 variant and relaxed restrictions. But Whitmer has taken a decidedly incremental approach on reinstating distancing rules as her state is overwhelmed by new cases. At a press conference on Friday, she took a position that indicated a reluctance to reinstate full-blown lockdowns. We all have to step up our game for the next two weeks to bring down rising cases, she said. And thats why Im calling on high schools to voluntarily go remote for two weeks past spring break, Im calling on youth sports to voluntarily suspend games and practices for two weeks, and Im strongly encouraging all Michiganders to avoid dining indoors and avoid gathering with friends indoors for two weeks. Policy alone wont change the tide. We need everyone to step up and to take personal responsibility, she said. Whitmer emphasized that she wasnt making restrictions mandatory, but didnt rule out future restrictions. Her actions in this situation stand in contrast to her use of state of emergency executive orders and stay-at-home orders last spring to bring down the rate of cases in her state  a response that was popular but also elicited vociferous push-back from conservative activists and the states Republican-controlled legislature. A growing number of public health officials and experts are calling on Whitmer to take more aggressive action, and it is possible that she will do so at some point in the future. But for now, there are a few factors that could be playing a role in her resistance to issuing mandated actions. One is the issue of efficacy. A great deal of polling data shows that fatigue with Covid-19 restrictions is a very real phenomenon, and that even many months ago people were reporting a decline in compliance with rules. Whitmer might be concerned that with the spread of the vaccine, better weather, the relaxation of restrictions in other states, and growing optimism, it could be difficult to achieve compliance with mandatory restrictions. There could be a concern that making rules required will make people resentful while not significantly improving health outcomes. Another factor is political calculation. She may fear backlash and disapproval at a time when people are sick of restrictions, something of concern to her as she approaches reelection next year  in a state where Republicans control the legislature and have wasted no opportunities to paint her past Covid-19 restrictions as tyrannical. Political observers believe Whitmers management of the pandemic will play a pivotal role in determining her reelection  and the reality is that perception of the virus is different now than it was a year ago. But some public health experts say that trying to take what seems like a moderate position on social distancing during a crisis-level surge is a dangerous mistake. What it looks like happened is she tried to be fair and meet us in the middle, Debra Furr-Holden, a Michigan State University epidemiologist whom Whitmer appointed to a coronavirus task force, told the New York Times. And what I think weve learned  and I hope other states will get the message  is that there really isnt a lot of middle ground here. We just have to tighten up and hold tight. Vox turns 7 this month.

            "content": "Brexit and suspicions of favoritism are fueling a conflict that has been simmering for years despite peace accords. Rioting in Northern Ireland continued on Friday night, with demonstrators using gas bombs against the police and setting a car on fire in the capital of Belfast. The night of violence marked the eighthstraight day of demonstrations and unrest in five towns and cities across Northern Ireland  a trend that has some experts worried about the possibility that the region could be seeing a sustained resurgence of sectarian violence. Saturday, April 10, is the 23rd anniversary of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement that ended 30 years of such conflict, known as the Troubles, but unrest and violence has flared up from time to time ever since. Over the past week, a double-decker bus has been hijacked and set on fire; masked youths have hurled homemade gas bombs at police; rival gangs have thrown bricks and fireworks at each other. So far there have been no deaths reported, but at least 74 police officers have been injured, and observers say that the period of turbulence marks the worst sectarian violence Northern Ireland has seen in eight years. Voxs German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administrations unprecedented burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. Most of the rioters are young people  some as young as 12, the Police Service of Northern Ireland told CNN. The violence has been concentrated in unionist communities, but conflict has also taken place in areas dividing unionist communities from nationalist neighborhoods. During the Troubles, unionists were largely Protestant and identified with loyalty to the United Kingdom, and nationalists were mostly Catholics, identified as Irish, and sought a united Ireland. While conflict between the groups formally ended with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, tensions and violence that hark back to the Troubles still resurface, and are often tied to concerns that one group holds undue influence or power over national affairs. The current set of clashes has become high-profile enough that the Biden administration released a brief statement expressing concern about rising violence. Experts say that there is not one clear explanation for the recent clashes, but that there are a few different factors  which may be feeding off of each other. Brexit, and the sense in unionist communities that London is neglecting Northern Ireland by the terms of the agreement are one factor. Another issue is a recent decision by authorities to avoid prosecuting nationalist politicians for flouting Covid-19 protocols. What is clear is that political observers see violence escalating at a worrying pace. I think its very serious. Its easy to see how things can escalate and hard to see how things can calm down, Katy Hayward, a professor of political sociology at Queens University, Belfast, told the New York Times. Conflict and violence between unionists and nationalists dates back decades. But the most recent spate of violence seems to be, at least in part, a response to a specific flashpoint in the relationship between the two communities. A great deal of the initial violence came after state prosecutors decided last month they would not charge the leaders of nationalist party Sinn Fein for breaking Covid-19 regulations in June by attending the funeral for Bobby Storey. Storey was a former top member of the Irish Republican Army, the paramilitary group that waged a violent campaign against the British and for a reunified Ireland during the Troubles. Many unionists perceived the decision to not prosecute the members of the party as a sign of political favoritism, given that unionists were told to cancel their traditional Twelfth of July parades last summer, and the loaded symbolism surrounding the funeral. The decision sparked outrage and protests. This is happening because of the PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland] and the judiciary systems appeasement of republicans, said Ian Edwards, a resident of the Shankill Road, a Protestant community, referring to the nationalists who favor a united Ireland. Experts say another major factor fueling the anger and protests is the way that many in Northern Ireland feel betrayed by the terms of Brexit  the United Kingdoms departure from the European Union  which was completed at the beginning of this year. In this scenario, unionists feel blindsided by the British government, which they believe has left them in a lurch, as the New York Times reports: Under an agreement in a protocol struck by [British Prime Minister Boris] Johnson, Northern Ireland was given a special economic status that leaves it straddling the United Kingdom and the European Union trade systems. However, it also imposes some new checks, particularly on goods flowing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland  something that is anathema to unionists who want equal treatment with the rest of the United Kingdom. Despite the deal he signed up to, Mr. Johnson promised that there would be no new border in the Irish Sea, and, glossing over the looming difficulties, his government did little to prepare opinion in Northern Ireland for the changes. Yet on Jan. 1, when the post-Brexit trade rules came into force, businesses faced new paperwork and some British companies stopped moving goods to Northern Ireland, causing some shortages on supermarket shelves. Amid rising tensions, checks on goods were halted temporarily after threats were made against customs staff. In other words, Northern Ireland unionists feel theyve been misled about the terms of Brexit and the economic impact it would have on them. Another complicating factor is that the period around the Easter holiday often features increased communal conflict, Politico notes, because of Irish Republican Army commemorations among nationalists in Northern Ireland on the one side and unionist parades on the other. Further complications may be coming from criminal groups who might be trying to add to the chaos and exploit tensions over Covid-19 restrictions in order to cause problems for law enforcement. Theres a complex array of factors that could explain whats contributing to the current chaos  and given that swirl, it could evolve further in the future. Vox turns 7 this month.

Los Angeles police said three children under the age of 5 were discovered dead in the Reseda neighborhood Saturday morning. A mother is in custody after authorities discovered three deceased children in an apartment building in the Reseda neighborhood of Los Angeles Saturday morning. All three children were believed to be under the age of 5, police said. Police did not confirm a motive or a cause of death, but multiple local media outlets report the children were stabbed to death. Police discovered the bodies of the children while responding to a call about a possible death in an apartment along the 8000 block of Reseda Boulevard. The mother, 30-year-old Liliana Carrillo, was taken into custody later Saturday in the Ponderosa area of Tulare County more than 200 miles away, in Central California. Police said Carrillo allegedly stole a silver Toyota pickup truck in the Bakersfield area before she was arrested. \"She is considered the sole suspect in this case,\" the Los Angeles Police Department said. Today at about 9:30 AM, West Valley Patrol Officers responded to the 8000 block of Reseda Blvd for a radio call involving a possible death at one of the apartments. The officers went inside an apartment and discovered 3 children at scene. The official cause of death has not yet been determined, but the LAPD said an investigation would be conducted with the Robbery-Homicide Division and the Juvenile Division. \"These are the moments we carry throughout our career,\" Lt. Raul Joel told the Los Angeles Times at the scene. \"It's hard to process that as a police officer.\" The children's grandmother was the person who called police after discovering their bodies, the Times reported. Joel told the paper there had not been any prior calls to police at the residence."

It will sustain us in this particular loss and at this particularly sad time.\" Starting at noon local time (7 a.m. ET), members of the Royal Artillery fired one round each minute, totaling 41 rounds. The ceremonies occurred in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast  as well as on multiple Royal Navy warships and in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Philip was married to Queen Elizabeth II for over 73 years. He holds the longest tenure as a royal consort in the history of the British monarchy. \"The Armed Forces are immensely proud of their close relationship with Prince Philip,\" the British Ministry of Defense said in a statement after the gun salutes began.

There is also an online condolence book the public can sign. That said, a line of people hoping to leave flowers has formed in front of Buckingham Palace. Crowds are also congregating outside Windsor Castle. The funeral is set for April 17 at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle and will allow a maximum of 30 attendees, multiple news outlets report. Philip will lie at rest at Windsor Castle instead of lying in state, a choice he made before his death."

            "content": "The Chinese government says it is issuing a $2.8 billion fine on the e-commerce company Alibaba Group for violating its anti-monopoly regulations. Alibaba is one of the most influential tech giants in China and the world. The company was under investigation by the Chinese government since December for \"suspected monopolistic conduct.\" In a statement Saturday, China's State Administration for Market Supervision described the company's behaviors as having \"eliminated and restricted competition in the online retail platform service market\" as well as having \"infringed on the business of the merchants on the platform.\" The fine is 4% of Alibaba's total 2019 sales in China  which was 456 billion yuan, or over $69 billion. In a press release issued Saturday, Alibaba said it would accept the fine and \"ensure its compliance with determination.\" \"The penalty issued today served to alert and catalyze companies like ours,\" the release said. \"It reflects the regulators' thoughtful and normative expectations toward our industry's development. It is an important action to safeguard fair market competition and quality development of Internet platform economies.\" The fine comes after months of complications for Alibaba. In November, Alibaba's affiliate, Ant Group, was unable to jumpstart a seismic initial public stock offering, forecasted to raise $37 billion. The process was stopped by financial regulators in Shanghai and Hong Kong just two days before the IPO was expected to list. In October, Alibaba co-founder and former CEO Jack Ma also made controversial comments during a business conference in Shanghai, publicly taking issue with China's financial system. \"China does not have a systemic financial risk problem. Chinese finance basically does not carry risk; rather, the risk comes from lacking a system,\" he said. He also went on to criticize the country's state banks, comparing them to \"pawnshops.\" Following his comments, Ma did not appear in public again until late January when he spoke via video at an event for rural teachers in China. Alibaba is expected to further respond to the government's imposed fine during a scheduled conference call set for Monday morning Hong Kong time."

Tom Sullivan, pictured here in 2019 introducing former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, says now is not the time to push for a statewide ban on assault-style weapons. Colorado state Rep. Tom Sullivan, pictured here in 2019 introducing former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, says now is not the time to push for a statewide ban on assault-style weapons. Any major push to pass an assault-style weapons ban in Colorado is looking increasingly less likely, with the legislature's highest-profile advocate for stricter gun laws saying now  weeks after the mass shooting that killed 10 people at a grocery store in the city of Boulder  isn't the time. \"It diverts all of the attention,\" says Democratic Rep. Tom Sullivan. Instead, Sullivan wants to focus efforts on policies he believes would be more effective at preventing gun violence. Technology, he says, can circumvent bans on specific types of weapons. \"They work around it, with printers at home, or ordering piece by piece, that has no serial number on it,\" he says. \"And they manufacture something that could be deemed an assault weapon.\" These so-called \"ghost guns\" are one of the items President Biden announced executive action on from the White House this week. The president is also looking at model legislation on a national \"red flag\" law and regulations on stabilizing braces. Sullivan got involved with politics after his son, Alex, was killed in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting. He's sponsored several gun bills, including Colorado's 2019 red flag law and one this session that requires people to report lost and stolen firearms. This year, two proposals around gun safety were introduced before the mass shooting in Boulder. One bill would require safe storage of firearms. Sullivan sponsored a different measure that has passed both chambers that would require people to report lost and stolen guns. Another proposal to require safe storage of firearms is also moving through the state legislature. Sullivan says he worries that if members of his party introduced a bill to ban assault-style weapons, it will make it harder to pass other reforms. \"I've had this conversation since the day Alex was murdered,\" Sullivan says about the debate about what policies to push for. \"It's a slow process, again, like all of the major changing legislation that is gripping our country, from voters rights and women's rights and LGBTQ rights, civil rights and racial equality. Those all take a lot of time. And, you know, I believe that we're on the right path.\" For a ban to be effective, Sullivan says he believes it would have to happen at the federal level. \"If we were to ban something here, it'd be very easy to go to any of the surrounding states.\" Some Democratic lawmakers began discussing the possibility of pushing for a ban after 10 people were killed last month. The accused gunman allegedly used a Ruger AR-556 pistol, with a brace that makes it operate more like a rifle. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis tells CPR's Colorado Mattersthat he is not focused on the type of firearm that was used in the massacre. Instead, Polis would like Colorado to strengthen universal background checks. \"What's striking from this case is  how was this young man, who had a prior history of [a] violent offense, able to legally buy a gun?\" asks Polis. \"I think he had two guns, right? I'm not concerned about the model of the gun at this point. Why was he able to buy a weapon when he had a recent conviction for a violent offense?\" The accused shooter was arrested in 2017 on a misdemeanor assault charge, pled guilty and spent a year on probation. That criminal history was not enough to prohibit him from legally buying a gun under current Colorado law. Polis says he wants lawmakers to discuss what would have \"the biggest impact on keeping people safe.\" \"Let's look at the classification of violent offense that prohibits you from purchasing a gun, at least for a period of time, maybe a decade, maybe five years.\" Colorado passed universal background checks in 2013, after the shootings in Aurora and at the Sandy Hook Elementary school in Connecticut. That year the state also passed a high capacity magazine ban. More recently, Polis signed the so-called \"red flag\" gun law that allows the courts to temporarily remove firearms from people who are determined to be a danger to themselves or others. Polis said that law could be even more effective. \"[It] could have been used in this instance. Family didn't know about it,\" says Polis. \"We need better outreach. It's been mostly used by law enforcement. We'd like to make sure that families know about it  when parents see their kid with a gun and they're worried about their mental state, and they're showing signs of risk, an extreme risk protection order can be a great tool.\" Even without Sullivan's discouragement, moving forward with an assault weapons ban would be a tall order for Democrats in the state. At least two other statehouse Democrats are likely to vote against any such bill. One of them is Senate President Leroy Garcia, who was among the few Democratic lawmakers to oppose the red flag law. He argued the policy does not respect the \"rights of responsible gun owners.\""

Visitors leave the Wonder Wheel ride after the re-opening of Coney Island's amusement parks on Friday. Coney Island's eccentric orchestra is back: Roller coaster carts tick up, up, up and then plummet and swerve along winding tracks. Rides hum, buzz and creak to the beat of carnival music. After a year of being shut down due to the pandemic, Coney Island's two amusement parks, Luna Park and Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, have reopened  at a third of their normal capacity. At Deno's, kids and adults face off to see who can squirt water into the mouth of a clown fastest  and get a balloon to pop like a firecracker. Emily Dobbins, 10, says this is her first time at an amusement park since the summer of 2019. Her favorite ride is the iconic Wonder Wheel. It's a 15-story Ferris wheel  but some of its carts are stationary and others shake and swing. She always picks the shaking carts and loves the views from the ride. \"I can actually see like the whole amusement park and it's really beautiful,\" Emily says. The Wonder Wheel was actually built during the 1918 pandemic. \"It's the thing that makes us who we are. We're the family that runs the Wonder Wheel,\" says DJ Vourderis. His family has owned and operated Deno's Amusement Park since it opened over a century ago. Vourderis has worried about losing his family's identity and closing down for good  he says Deno's has made virtually no money for the past year. \"The financial hole that we're in is deep. And we have creditors knocking on the door,\" he says. In Coney Island, the amusement parks and local businesses rely on each other  no visitors at the parks for the past year has meant less revenue for nearby shops. Haim Haddad, who owns the Coney Island Beach Shop, says he expects the reopened amusement parks to bring in more business than last spring and summer. Haim Haddad, who owns the Coney Island Beach Shop, says he expects the reopened amusement parks to bring in more business than last spring and summer. Haim Haddad owns the Coney Island Beach Shop, a couple blocks from Deno's. He usually has up to seven employees. \"Last season I had only one employee,\" he says. Haddad says the parks will bring more customers to his shop, especially if the weather is good. He still doesn't expect the kind of sales he used to see, just better numbers than in spring and summer 2020. At Coney Island Brewery, Victoria Pitula, the assistant general manager, says she's already seeing more traffic and visitors. Pitula has lived in Coney Island her entire life and says when the amusement park rides are open, they give the whole neighborhood a joyful, captivating energy. \"Just seeing them almost brought tears to my eyes. Like you can see the Thunderbolt is right behind us and we hear it like come by and the screams of people. That's what gives us energy here,\" she says. Outside the Thunderbolt roller coaster, Gerald White watches riders get strapped in. He says his stomach is too weak for most of the rides, but he did grab some classic Coney Island food. \"I had some frog legs and some raw clams and a Corona,\" he says. White came to Coney Island a lot as a kid and wanted to cheer the parks on. He says the crowds are small compared to normal but that's probably a good thing, for now."

            "content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Atlantic staff writer Yasmeen Serhan about her recent piece. We've talked about whether so-called vaccine passports are legal and whether they might be necessary for travel. Now we want to ask whether bringing them into widespread use is the right thing to do. Yasmeen Serhan is worried about this. She wrote a piece for The Atlantic titled \"The Futility Of Vaccine Passports.\" In it, she argues that vaccine passports could divide society into two groups, the jabbed and the jab-less. And Yasmeen Serhan is with us now from London. Welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. YASMEEN SERHAN: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So let's just begin with the premise of your piece. Why do you think asking people to provide proof of vaccination would create social divisions, especially because it does seem as though eventually everybody is going to be eligible for a shot? SERHAN: Yeah, totally. I mean, and that's certainly more true in the U.S., I think, than it is even here in the U.K., where vaccination is going really well, and certainly other parts of the world. But, yeah, I mean, you know, I think for much of this crisis, so much of the narrative - certainly this is the case in the U.K., but I think this could be applied to other countries, too - has been about the togetherness. Like, you know, we need to get through this crisis together. You know, I recall when this crisis first started, Boris Johnson said that all Britons were directly enlisted in this fight. And, you know, it's kind of been this way throughout. And now we're being faced with the prospect of introducing a system that would kind of be, you know, just a very clear division between those who have been vaccinated and those who aren't. But it also poses a problem because some people and certainly some communities, particularly here in Britain, minority ethnic communities, still have some hesitations about the jab and, you know, still need some reassurance from the government. And implementing a system like this is something that public health experts fear could, you know, drive up that hesitation at a time where you really want to be shoring up confidence in the jab. MARTIN: So even if there is a social cost, are there good public policy reasons to institute a system like this? For example, I mean, I don't know what the system is in Britain, but in the United States, I mean, most states have some sort of vaccination protocol for children to attend public school. And there are opt-outs. But we've seen that in circumstances where people are opting out, there are real costs to that. I mean, diseases that have all been eradicated are resurfacing because people are refusing to get their kids vaccinated. And that has become a real problem. So even if people do have hesitation, aren't there good faith reasons to try to push people to get vaccinated by perhaps denying them access to places they might want to go, like pubs, if they don't? SERHAN: It's a good question. I think absolutely. There are definitely reasons for all of us that we would want people to get vaccinated and for everyone to be healthy 100%. But I think making it seem like it's de facto compulsory or that, you know, you're going to be shut out of public life if you don't take the vaccine, that that could rub some people the wrong way and could indeed provide fodder to anti-vaxxers who want to, you know, minimize trust in the vaccine, who want to undermine it by saying, look, the government is trying to tell you what to do. SERHAN: I think, you know, obviously, trying to ramp up the rollout and make sure everyone gets access to the vaccine - you know, I think it's much easier to argue that it's an incentive, even if you want to do something like this, once everyone has access to the vaccine. But I think the best way, like - you know, you kind of have - even if you did implement something like this, like, I think it's not a proper replacement for doing the kind of community engagement to really encourage people - like, to really answer their questions and explain why the vaccine is safe. You know, I think one thing that needs to be understood about vaccine hesitancy is that, you know, it's very different from just anti-vax sentiment. Like, hesitancy is by definition an undecided state. And I think, you know, those people can very easily be brought onside if you answer their questions, if you kind of encourage them and assuage any concerns they have - you know, kind of debunk misinformation about the vaccines. I think all of that work needs to be done first before you introduce something like this. MARTIN: But what do you say to people who say, look, I haven't seen my grandkids in a year? I'm doing all the right things, and my ability to move about society is already compromised by people who aren't doing the right things, who aren't wearing masks, who aren't taking care of themselves. What do you say to them? SERHAN: It's - like, you know, I mean, I think it's a fair criticism. And obviously, we're all - you know, we're all struggling with this. You know, my family lives in California. I haven't seen them in well over a year. I'm buzzing to see them again. But I think we need to - you know, it's in everyone's incentive to obviously make sure that everyone gets vaccinated and that we can reopen our societies. But I think, you know, if public health experts are saying this sort of policy could alienate communities and prevent them from getting vaccinated, I think in the long term, that's a big issue. And we don't want this to be, you know, a virus that only affects minorities and the poor. I mean, you know, I don't think that's a solution either. I think - you know, I'm willing to wait it out a bit longer if we can all get vaccinated and all be able to start resuming, you know, the things we love about life the most together, whether that's going to the pub with your friends, hugging your grandmother - all those things.

            "content": "More businesses are requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccines. NPR's Michel Martin discusses legal implications with Robert Field, professor of law and public health at Drexel University. Have you gotten your jab? If so - maybe even if not - you're probably among the tens of millions who are ready to get out of the house and go somewhere, which is one reason why the idea of a vaccine passport has become an intriguing idea and the latest political flashpoint related to COVID. What are we talking about? Similar to that passport you show across an international border, the idea is that people would be required to show proof of vaccination before going certain places - concert halls, gyms, maybe airplanes, maybe whole countries. So we decided to spend the next few minutes looking at this from different angles. Later, we'll dive into how the travel industry is thinking about this. We're also going to ask about the social implications, whether this could open up new divides. But first, we want to talk about the question that immediately comes to mind - are vaccine passports legal? Several prominent Republicans and libertarians have claimed that they are a breach of privacy. The governors of Texas and Florida, both Republicans, have taken steps to prevent businesses and agencies within their states from requiring patrons to use them. So what does the law say about this? To help us answer that, we've called professor Robert Field. He teaches law and public health management and policy at Drexel University, and he's with us now. Professor Field, welcome. Thanks for joining us. ROBERT FIELD: Thank you. MARTIN: So, first of all, is there any precedent for this? I mean, I think that in most places, there are pretty strict rules around kids attending school or enrolling in school. You have to show proof of vaccination, or you have to have some pretty strict reasons for not getting vaccinations. So is there any precedent that people are looking to around this? FIELD: Well, school vaccines are definitely a precedent. Every state has rules for vaccination before a child can attend school. They vary in a lot of the details, but every state has them. For international travel, there are some countries that require vaccines against yellow fever and other endemic diseases. We had vaccine passports of a sort even a hundred years ago, when we were worried about plague and smallpox. So this is not a new concept, and it is, in fact, precedented. MARTIN: So what's the state of things now, though? Because I confess that other than the school example, I wasn't aware of the other ones that you cited there. FIELD: In terms of adults, there are groups that are subject to mandates. One is immigrants to get a green card or citizenship, and the other is members of the military. So there's a precedent for that as well. There's been a change in the law over the last hundred years, most notably with regard to disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, says that an employer or a business cannot discriminate against people based on a disability. And if someone were not able to take the vaccine because they were immunocompromised or allergic to vaccine components or some other reason, they could argue that they were being discriminated against based on that disability. Other than that, however, in the absence of a state law prohibiting vaccine passports, as we may be seeing in Florida and Texas, there's nothing to prevent a private business from instituting it. MARTIN: So let's talk about the - Florida and Texas to this point. They have issued executive orders targeting the use of these passports. They say that this raises privacy concerns. What are your thoughts about that? FIELD: I don't see this raising major privacy concerns. The information that you provide would be voluntary. If it's a business that you don't have to use, if it's a theater or public transportation or a health club, it's your decision whether to go in there or not. So I don't see the legal aspects of the privacy issue as particularly significant. MARTIN: Well, we called you for your expertise in this field, so I thank you for that. But I am interested if you have an opinion about whether vaccine passports are good public policy or not. FIELD: I think a passport of some sort is good public policy. I think the term passport is somewhat unfortunate because it sounds like a national passport that restricts your freedom of travel. And if we meant really evidence of immunity, where you could show it in different ways - immunization, recovery from the virus, a recent negative test - it would be much more flexible, would accommodate most people's objections and would be very important in terms of reopening our economy and our society. Think of it - you run, say, a health club. Would you want to be able to reassure your customers that the risk of infection is extremely low? This is the most effective way to do it. Why would we want to prevent them from doing that? We could let the market decide. We could let some health clubs require proof of immunity and others not and see who gets business and who doesn't. But I think for the government to come in and restrict the ability of private entities to make their facilities as safe as possible is not good public policy, and it's certainly not in the interests of ending the pandemic. MARTIN: That was professor Robert Field. He is the director of the JD Master of Public Health Program at Drexel University School of Law. Professor Field, thanks so much for joining us.

            "content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Victoria Walker, senior travel reporter for The Points Guy, about airline companies' use of digital COVID-19 vaccine cards. Let's talk about travel now. If you've flown internationally lately, then you will be familiar with the requirement by many governments and airlines that you present proof of a negative COVID test to board the flight. Now several airlines, including United and JetBlue, are testing apps that would similarly show if a traveler has been vaccinated against COVID-19. We wanted to know more about how this is working, so we called Victoria Walker. She is senior travel reporter for The Points Guy. That's a site that reports on travel news, airline mileage programs and credit cards. And she's with us now. Victoria Walker, welcome. VICTORIA WALKER: Thank you for having me, Michel. MARTIN: So, first of all, we understand that vaccine passports, which is a term that we've been using, might actually be a misleading term. So how do these apps actually work in practice? WALKER: So a digital health or vaccine passport is a digital form of proof that you have either taken the COVID-19 vaccine or you have proof of a negative COVID-19 test. So currently, the only way to confirm your vaccine status in the United States is through a card from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Basically, with these digital health passports, the travel industry hopes that they will streamline the overall travel experience. Now, vaccine passport is a pretty broad term, and several travel providers, including IATA, which is coming out with its own travel pass - they shy away from the term passport altogether. American Airlines and British Airways have the VeriFLY app. United is working with CommonPass. But basically, this is what the travel industry is really excited about in order to kind of streamline the travel experience. WALKER: The airlines are generally in favor of the use of digital health passports. But most of the airlines weren't necessarily in favor of having vaccine requirements to travel. In fact, they asked the White House to exempt vaccinated travelers from international testing requirements. And travel trade groups such as IATA have also indicated that they don't want there to be a requirement for a vaccine in order to travel. So basically, the last thing the U.S. travel industry wants is more restrictions to travel. The airline industry wasn't in favor of a domestic testing mandate, but they do support the U.S. standardizing these health documents like COVID-19 vaccines and negative test results. WALKER: Correct. WALKER: Countries, especially those heavily reliant on tourism, will make it easier for vaccinated travelers to skip those expensive testing and quarantine requirements. So the Seychelles initially opened to people who were fully vaccinated, but they didn't open to everyone. And Iceland is now open to vaccinated travelers. MARTIN: You're a travel news website. I know that you hear a lot from travelers, right? WALKER: Yes. MARTIN: They're very vocal. I was just wondering - so you were telling us earlier that the travel industry doesn't want restrictions. They would like as few restrictions as possible because they want people to travel. What - are you hearing anything from travelers? Are they saying that they would rather the industry require a COVID vaccine in order to get on a plane? Or what - are they expressing themselves on this yet? Or is it still too new? WALKER: The vast majority of travelers I've spoken to have been cooped up in their houses for a little over a year, and they're ready to get back and experience traveling again. A reader I was speaking to a few weeks ago kind of compared it to how the flying experience changed after Sept. 11, where travelers had to take off the shoes and go through enhanced security screening. And it's something that, you know, travelers will eventually have to adjust to. And the vast majority of the travelers that I've spoken to about this topic and about, you know, traveling, travel reopening, have pretty much said the same thing. MARTIN: That was Victoria Walker, senior travel reporter for The Points Guy. That's a travel news website. Victoria Walker, thank you. WALKER: Thank you so much, Michel. Copyright  2021 NPR.

            "content": "We are going to turn our attention now to the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd. That gruesome event last May, captured on cameras carried by police and bystanders alike, has become a touchstone, setting off some of the largest demonstrations for social and racial justice in history. And now the trial has also become a cultural event, captured by cameras, broadcast live. We wanted to talk about that, which media organizations are covering the trial and how and what effect this could be having on viewers. And we're joined now by Eric Deggans, who reports on television and has been thinking about this. Eric, welcome. Thanks for joining us. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So we are now speaking at the end of the second week of the trial. How has this been treated as a media event? So I take it that the networks are taking very different approaches. DEGGANS: Yeah, we've seen some cable TV news channels go into continuous coverage mode as the trial is going on, so CNN, MSNBC, HLN. Court TV used it as a way to sort of relaunch the channel to get attention for a new version of Court TV. And then there are some channels that are not covering it continuously, most notably Fox News and Newsmax TV, two cable channels that are conservative-oriented. And then you also have the tack where some channels are updating. So there's a lot of different coverage options for people who want to watch it. And I think that's actually a good thing because so much of this testimony can be traumatizing. And, you know, people sometimes have this habit of turning on CNN or turning on a cable channel when it's showing something like a trial that goes on for hours and just having it run as sort of wallpaper while they do their work. And you don't understand how much that can agitate you, how much that can traumatize you in ways that you're not consciously aware of. So I'm just asking people to focus on how much of this trial you're consuming. Be careful about how much you're consuming. And if you feel like it's affecting you personally, then there's nothing wrong with stepping away from it and maybe catching up with it later. MARTIN: I want to isolate a couple things that you talked about and talk about those things separately. The first thing I want to ask you about is - why do you think the networks are taking such a different approach to this subject matter? Notably, you said that, well, Court TV - that is - that has been - their signature is, you know, covering trials, you know, continuously. And you're saying that the right-leaning channels are not. I'm just interested in your thoughts about why there are such different approaches. DEGGANS: Well, being somebody who's covered TV for a long time, I am super cynical about the media business. And so I think a great deal of this is rooted in ratings and audience. If a news and information channel thinks that continuous coverage of the trial will boost their viewership or for some reason, it - their audience expects it, they will provide it. And if they think it will hurt their ratings, then they won't cover it. Or they will cover it more sporadically. And so, you know, Court TV decided to relaunch. And of course, a high-profile trial is a great way to get people to pay attention to the channel as it reemerges. Fox News. I'm betting the reason why Fox News and Newsmax are not covering it continuously is because their audience does not want to see it and certainly doesn't want to see it, continuously. And so their ratings would probably drop if they covered it continuously. And I think they're aware of that. MARTIN: So, Eric, have people been interested in watching this? I understand that The New York Times is reporting that viewer interest is high and that for several days last week, for example, CNN's highest ratings came in the afternoon during witness testimony rather than during its prime-time hours. DEGGANS: That makes sense. But if those ratings are from last week, that's from when the trial was starting. And the sense that I'm getting, again, just from talking to people and sort of discussing this issue on social media and things like that is that as the trial wears on, particularly the prosecution end of it wears on, people are starting to realize they're hearing the same ideas. And I think there's also a sense that this video of George Floyd dying has been in the public space for almost a year now. And people have kind of made their decisions about what they think happened. And so barring some kind of testimony that seems, you know, sort of remarkable - like, I think if Derek Chauvin testifies, that will be a landmark moment. And tons of people will want to see that in real time. I'm not surprised that - you know, that people are tuning in. But my own sense is that there are also a lot of people who are moderating their consumption of the trial because it's just too tough for them to watch. MARTIN: You know, I'm really fascinated by your - you've mentioned this several times about how people are trying to figure out how much of this to watch. One of the reasons that's interesting is - well, it's interesting on any number of levels. But it's hard not to note the parallels with the O.J. Simpson trial that also riveted the world and had people glued to their TVs. This is very different for a lot of reasons. I wanted to ask you about that. But one of them is that I don't remember there being any discussion during that trial of - should we really be watching this? So just - would you just talk a little bit about that, like, how this compares to the O.J. Simpson trial? DEGGANS: Sure. Sure. I mean, in some ways there are similarities in that these were both very high-profile events that produced international reaction. We're getting continuous coverage of both trials available on many different TV outlets. But O.J. Simpson was a celebrity and was accused of a very specific crime. And that trial was sort of the - a coming together of a bunch of things, you know, questions about how celebrities are treated by law enforcement, questions about how law enforcement polices people of color, even when you're celebrity, questions about even whether cameras should even be allowed to broadcast the trial. In this case, you know, we're at a point where we've seen George Zimmerman's trial, continuous coverage of a lot of high profile, you know, trials. So - and also, this is a situation where I think it's easier for people of color, especially, to put themselves in George Floyd's shoes and feel as if this could happen to them or this could happen to a relative or this can happen to someone they care about and see themselves - excuse me - in what happened. And then beyond that, we also have a situation where we have witnessed a lot of trauma on television related to the policing, the killing of Black people at the hands of law enforcement. And so now, we're aware of how that affects us when we see it on television because we've experienced it so often and for so long. And so I think - you know, I think it's important that people keep an eye on that. And I'm glad that it's part of the conversation now. MARTIN: That was NPR's TV writer Eric Deggans. Eric, thank you so much. DEGGANS: Thanks for having me. Copyright  2021 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "content": "NPR's Michel Martin talks with Alain Stephens, who covers gun control and violence for The Trace, about President Biden's proposed actions to reduce gun violence. We're going to begin today by addressing something President Biden has called a public health epidemic and an international embarrassment. I'm talking about gun violence. There have been dozens of incidents involving gun-related violence with multiple victims in just the past month. At a Thursday press conference, the president outlined a number of actions he's taking to address it, reining in so-called ghost guns, which we will explain later, and directing the Justice Department to draft so-called red flag laws for states to model. Those would prevent someone from accessing a gun if they pose a danger to themselves or others. And the president urged Congress to enact legislation. As we said, this announcement comes amid a spasm of mass shootings, some which have gotten national attention and some which have not, so we wanted to talk more about how effective these laws might be in actually addressing gun violence. For that, we've called Alain Stephens from The Trace. That's an independent, nonpartisan news organization that reports on guns and gun violence. Alain Stephens, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us once again. ALAIN STEPHENS: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: As we said, President Biden announced a series of actions that the administration wants to take, and he called gun violence a public health epidemic. And you've been reporting on this for a while. Do you agree with that characterization? STEPHENS: Yes, I do. I mean, gun violence is something - I think we pay a lot of attention to things like mass shootings. But gun violence in America, common neighborhood gun violence, is extremely common, and - as well as suicides and accidental shootings. And, yeah, we have seen a huge explosion as well with gun sales related to COVID, as well as another kind of surge of gun sales during the Obama administration due to fears of gun control. So if it seems like there's a lot more guns out there, that's perhaps because there probably is. MARTIN: So President Biden says he wants to rein in so-called ghost guns. The first thing I'm going to ask you is, what are those? STEPHENS: These weapons are essentially something that you could snap together within minutes. And because of this, this has appealed not only to, you know, hobbyists who want to build their own weapons and do so a lot easier, but it's also appealed to, you know, essentially, the criminal underworld who have, essentially, two really good reasons for doing this. One, you can get this weapon without having to go through background checks. If you have a criminal record or anything like that, none of that applies. Two, every time you go through a background check through kind of conventional means to purchase a weapon, essentially, it creates a paper trail that is a investigative lead that if that weapon eventually shows up in a crime, federal agents and law enforcement can go back and find things like arms trafficking patterns or how this gun went from creation to crime. Without this paperwork, essentially, the gun is untraceable. STEPHENS: The first thing is, yeah, the NRA is like, hey, why are you punishing law-abiding gun owners - right? - for something that criminals do? And I think that that reaction has kind of been a classic reaction for a lot of the gun control groups - right? - who they are advocating on behalf of what they say are, you know, the legal gun owners. The second thing is, is that they're also kind of responding on behalf of a lot of these parts kits, right? They manufacture these parts kits. It has been a lucrative thing, and they have interests as well. And a lot of those kind of manufacturers of parts kits are saying, well, this is allowed. What am I going to do in my business? They're kind of pushing more so the federal government to come up with some clarification. But overall, as far as the firearms market, I expect - and kind of the lobbyists I expect not to have the same level of kind of defensiveness just because this is still overall kind of a very small thing compared to, say, assault weapons in general or, you know, semiautomatic weapons in general because it is still kind of a very small sliver of the market. MARTIN: So I'm - now I'm going to ask you your opinion about this, as somebody who has covered this issue. So substantively, I'm interested in your take on how effective these steps will be in addressing the level of violence that I think most people consider unacceptable, even if they disagree about the best way to address it. STEPHENS: As far as ghost guns, I do think there is something significant to be said there. There is a level of bleeding-edge firearms technology that has been challenging law enforcement here and for the most part has gone unaddressed. So I do think that will significantly tamp down some of the more serious arms trafficking patterns and stuff like that. But as far as day-to-day gun crime, I mean, you're more likely to be shot in neighborhood community violence. And those things, as we look towards root causes, have more to do with economic inequality. They have more to do with failed law enforcement. They have more to do with these kind of root causes, right? So if we're trying to deal with gun violence, I think, in a way that most Americans are going to see it, it's going to probably take something a little bit more significant than a lot of these kind of technical regulations that we're just starting with right now. MARTIN: That was Alain Stephens, correspondent at the Trace. That's an independent, nonpartisan news organization that focuses on guns and gun violence. Alain Stephens, thanks so much for joining us.

            "content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks to psychiatrist Paul Nestadt about data that shows an increase in suicide rates among African Americans during the pandemic. We're going to move to another topic now - one that also touches on guns. The statistics show that a majority of gun deaths in America are actually suicides. And for the past year, many experts and laypeople alike have worried that the mental health stresses of the pandemic - isolation, job loss, lockdowns, the constant reminders about sickness and death - could lead to an increase in suicides. And while scientists are still combing through the data, the early findings suggest that might not have been the case except for one group - African Americans. According to one alarming recent study focusing on just one state during the first weeks of the lockdown, but alarming nonetheless, suicide mortality among African Americans nearly doubled while decreasing substantially among white residents. We wanted to learn more about this study, which focused on Maryland, so we called one of the co-authors. Dr. Paul Nestadt is assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a researcher who studies suicide. And before we continue, let me note that we know that this is a topic that may be upsetting to some, so if that's the case, we invite you to step away for a few minutes, and we'll be happy to welcome you back later on. Having said that, Dr. Nestadt, thank you so much for joining us. PAUL NESTADT: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So let's get all the sort of the disclaimers and the metrics and the caveats out there. Again, the study focused just on data from Maryland. And you compare data from three distinct periods - pre-COVID, while closures were happening, and then while reopening was happening - and you compared this information to the same periods in previous years. Do I have that right? NESTADT: That's absolutely right. MARTIN: So let me just read from the paper. (Reading) Among Black residents, suicide mortality appeared to double during period two compared with the means in 2017 to 2019. In contrast, suicide mortality appeared nearly halved among white residents during period two and three compared with the means of 2017 to 2019. And you point out that the population didn't change substantially between 2017 to 2019, so this would be - that's a significant change. NESTADT: Yeah, it's very significant. It actually was surprising in a couple of different ways. For one, as you mentioned, many experts thought that suicides in general were going to go up a lot during the pandemic because of all of those stressors that you listed at the beginning of the show. We didn't see that happen in aggregate. But when we disaggregated the data, as you said, the - during that, I guess we can call it now, the first wave of COVID in Maryland, in the United States in general, there was this incredible doubling of the suicide numbers in African Americans here. MARTIN: What made you want to look at this? As you point out in the piece, that to your knowledge, this is the first to characterize suicide trends by race and ethnicity during COVID-19. What made you take a look at this? NESTADT: Well, part of it is knowing that even if there is an aggregate decrease in suicide during COVID, as we were starting to see in Maryland, there are vulnerable populations that were hit more by COVID than others. We know that Black Marylanders had higher rates of COVID infection - this is the case nationwide as well - and also, once infected, higher case fatality rate. So, basically, this pandemic hit Black Marylanders a lot harder than white Marylanders. So there was reason to believe that there might be more distress, and suicide has traditionally been a marker of distress in our data. MARTIN: But why do you think that is, though, given that - I think your study indicates that suicide is more common generally among the white population. Is that accurate? NESTADT: That's true. That's true about nationwide, a majority of suicides are white. White Americans have a higher rate of suicide than Black Americans in general. MARTIN: And in Maryland as well. NESTADT: In Maryland as well. MARTIN: So this is a significant change. Do you have a theory about why that is? NESTADT: Yeah. Well, you know, we can make a lot of assumptions. I have some theories. I think part of it, as I mentioned, Black Marylanders were hit harder by the pandemic. They might have had less of an economic cushion to withstand things like job loss or less ability to draw on resources for things like child care. And there is no way to know for sure with these particular suicides if the pandemic played a role. But the correlation to the increase in infections and deaths and the suicide rate is hard to ignore. It might also be an issue of access to care. We know that Black Americans in general - and Black Marylanders are no exception - have more difficulty accessing care, have a higher likelihood of not having insurance. And that applies to mental health care as well. So having the ability to reach out and get help when you need help is really important. And that's something that we can prioritize and make sure there are resources available for everyone that needs psychiatric help when needed. MARTIN: I am going to make an assertion here which you may or may not agree with, but I'm going to make an assertion here that I think we don't often see African Americans as people who are vulnerable to suicide. And I wonder if you feel that this study amplifies our understanding of this as a significant concern. NESTADT: I absolutely think that you're correct. Because the majority of suicides have been among white Americans, there's been too little focus on suicides on people of color. We have had a relatively good history of looking at suicide in Native American, American Indian populations because there's high rates there as well. But specifically Black Americans, the rates have been going up faster than they have in white Americans. But we're recognizing more and more that risk for suicide is up there and increasing for Black Americans, especially younger Black males. In the white population, we see suicides more in middle age and sort of very old, like after 85. But the risk period is highest for Black Americans around age 20. And that's arguably much more tragic, to lose someone so young. MARTIN: Dr. Paul Nestadt is assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. He's one of the co-authors of a recent study on suicide mortality in Maryland during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. The study's published in the April 2021 issue of JAMA Psychiatry. Dr. Nestadt, thanks so much for talking to us today. NESTADT: Absolutely. Thanks for having me. Copyright  2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

            "content": "A comprehensive package of police reform measures cleared the Maryland General Assembly on Wednesday, including repeal of police job protections long cited as a barricade to accountability. A comprehensive package of police reform measures cleared the Maryland General Assembly on Wednesday, including repeal of police job protections long cited as a barricade to accountability. ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP)  Maryland lawmakers voted Saturday to override Republican Gov. Larry Hogan's vetoes of three far-reaching police reform measures that supporters say are needed to increase accountability and restore public trust. One of the measures repeals job protections in the police disciplinary process that critics say impede accountability. Maryland approved the nation's first Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights in 1974, and about 20 states have adopted similar laws setting due process procedure for investigating police misconduct. Maryland is the first to repeal the law, replacing it with new procedures that give civilians a role in the police disciplinary process. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly has been working on reforms for months, following nationwide protests against racial injustice that were fueled by the police custody death of George Floyd in Minnesota nearly one year ago. \"Last year, I attended and participated in multiple demonstrations of people demanding change  the young and the old, people of all races and walks of life,\" said Sen. Charles Sydnor, a Democrat who sponsored one of the measures. \"With so many situations being thrust before our eyes, we could no longer deny what we see, and I thank my colleagues for believing their eyes and listening to the majority of Marylanders.\" Opponents said the measures went too far. The package includes provisions to increase the civil liability limit on lawsuits involving police from $400,000 to $890,000. An officer convicted of causing serious injury or death through excessive force would face 10 years in prison. Sen. Robert Cassilly, a Republican, described the legislation as \"anti-cop.\" \"It allows for hindsight review of folks sitting in the easy chairs to judge people who made split-second decisions in volatile situations,\" when an officer fears for his or her life and the lives of others, Cassilly said. Hogan also vetoed legislation with a new statewide use-of-force policy and mandated use of body cameras statewide by July 2025. Another vetoed measure would expand public access to records in police disciplinary cases and limit the use of no-knock warrants. Under the bill, police could only use no-knock warrants between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., except in an emergency. In his veto message, Hogan wrote that he believed the measures would \"further erode police morale, community relationships, and public confidence.\" \"They will result in great damage to police recruitment and retention, posing significant risks to public safety throughout our state,\" Hogan wrote. But Sen. Jill Carter, a Baltimore Democrat, said erosion of public confidence occurs when nothing is done after residents file complaints against police, who are \"then able to exact retaliation for the complaint with full knowledge that there'll be no transparency, there'll be no public disclosure, and there'll be no repercussions.\" \"It's a critically important step in the right direction,\" said Carter, who sponsored the bill to increase public access to police disciplinary records. The measure is named after Anton Black, a 19-year-old African American who died in police custody in 2018 in a rural town on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Maryland has struggled with police accountability problems in recent years. Baltimore's police department entered into a federal consent decree after Freddie Gray suffered a broken neck in police custody and died, sparking unrest in the city in 2015. Lawmakers approved some police reforms the following year, but critics have said they were not enough. Hogan wrote that two measures would go into effect without his signature. One of them would create a unit in the attorney general's office to investigate police-involved deaths and prohibit law enforcement from buying surplus military equipment. The other would enable Baltimore voters to decide whether the state's largest city should take full control of the police department from the state. Separately on Saturday, the legislature also overrode Hogan's veto of a bill that will ban sentences of life in prison without possibility of parole for juveniles."

A photo of La Soufrire erupting Friday in St. Vincent. The blast could be sending ash as far as Jamaica and South America. La Soufrire, the highest peak on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, began to explosively erupt Friday morning, forcing thousands to evacuate as ash and smoke filled the sky. And a larger eruption may be on the way. Richard Robertson, a geologist with the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre, said the volcano is in its explosive eruption phase. The initial explosion of dust and debris St. Vincent experienced Friday is likely just the beginning. \"The explosive eruption has started and it is possible you could have more explosions like these,\" he said during a press conference. \"The first one is not necessarily the worst one, the first bang is not necessarily the biggest bang this volcano will give.\" Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, ordered residents on the northern side of the island to evacuate Thursday out of the red volcano danger zone. The Associated Press reported some 16,000 people were forced to flee their homes. Soot and ash fell throughout the night, blanketing neighborhoods and streets across the island Saturday morning. Robertson said the ash is expected to fall for the next handful of days, possibly even weeks. The dome of the volcano, which is about 3,100 feet long and more than 820 feet wide, was destroyed in Friday's eruption, catapulting 460 million cubic feet of debris into the atmosphere. The ash could reach as far as Jamaica and parts of South America, Robertson said. The last time La Soufrire had a major eruption was in 1979, which lasted several weeks. This eruption, Robertson said, \"will more than likely be a bigger eruption than 1979 was.\" He added, \"We don't know how much material is down there that wants to come out.\" The fine ash particles, which are difficult to clean up, pose a respiratory risk, especially for people with underlying issues. Robertson recommended that individuals who have decided to stay on the island do their best to clean the ash before it settles or gets wet. With more potential eruptions looming, Robertson advised residents to move as far south as possible. La Soufrire could be heard rumbling and grumbling throughout the night, he said, from the sound of magma moving inside the volcano."

            "content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Jamika Wilson, who is currently nominated for an Oscar in the hairstyling and makeup category for their work on the film Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. The film \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\" received five Oscar nominations last month, including best actress for Viola Davis, who plays the pioneering blues singer Ma Rainey as she and her band go through a recording session in 1920 Chicago. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (As character) All right, boys. You done seen the rest. Now I'm going to show you the best. Ma Rainey's going to show you how her Black bottom. MAXAYN LEWIS: (As Ma Rainey, singing) Way down south in Alabamy, I got a friend they call dancing Sammy who's crazy about all the latest dancing, black bottom stomps and the new way they prancing. MARTIN: Also nominated, Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson, who worked on the hairstyling for the film. They made history as the first two Black women ever nominated for an Academy Award in the hairstyle and makeup category. And we are joined now by one of the nominees, Jamika Wilson. Jamika, welcome. Congratulations. JAMIKA WILSON: Thank you. Thank you so much. WILSON: (Laughter) I am still really working hard. It's - really hasn't - it has sunk in with me. But just doing all the other things with the awards seasoning happening, it's been a tough challenge for me. MARTIN: I can imagine because on the movie, you work with Viola Davis as her personal hairstylist. And you continue to work with her. And now it's awards season when, even though everything's still on Zoom, people still want to look their best. Were there some - I don't know. I'm guessing having worked with Viola Davis before, it was - you knew her, so you had that relationship. But tell us some of the challenges of doing hair for the film. WILSON: First of all, I'm used to doing modern hairstyling. So being that this was a 1920s film, it was a challenge for me because, you know, when she first offered the opportunity to me, I had no idea of who Ma Rainey was. So I had to do my research and discovered that it was a period film. And this was my first experience with a period film. So my challenge was, you know, making sure that I was able to do the 1920s-era hairstyling. And then I discovered during the process that Mia was going to be coming along as the department head, and she had already designed the wig. So that made it a little bit more easier for me. But the challenge really for me was, you know, working with that era. MARTIN: I understand that the wigs were actually authentic to the era. Like, they were made of horsehair? WILSON: They were made of horsehair, yeah. MARTIN: Wow, that's wild. WILSON: The wigs were made of horsehair. It's very wild and - which I discovered with working with the horsehair wig that they are - it's almost like a synthetic wig today, you know? A lot of people think that it's really hot and heavy. The wig was actually very light, you know? Mia said that she - what she did was she ventilated the wig. And she did it strand by strand. She did not double strand. So I think that helped out a lot. But it was really a lightweight wig, surprisingly. MARTIN: Oh, well, that's good to know 'cause she does have it on for quite some time in the film. So let me ask you about Hollywood's track record when it comes to hair in general. I mean, the industry has a history of not working well with Black hair or let's just say hair that is other than straight and sleek. And you've heard stories from celebrities like Gabrielle Union and Halle Berry about their experiences with hairstylists who weren't trained to treat or work with their type of hair. So is that part of the reason you got into the business? Because that service wasn't being offered? Tell us a little bit about your story. WILSON: Yeah, I guess so. I guess you would say so. My experience - you know, I was working with Viola since 2008. And, yeah, she wanted someone there who could style her hair and handle it. And that is always a challenge when we're on set. African Americans are familiar with both types of hair, you know? We just don't do one texture of hair. We can do it all. And by actors now speaking up and saying that they want someone who can handle their hair, they have to bring an African American hairstylist because there's not very many Caucasian hairstylists that feel comfortable doing African American hair. MARTIN: Is there - obviously, you know, it's - you know, they all say it's just great to be nominated. It's an honor just to be nominated. But is there something that you hope will come from this history-making nomination? WILSON: Well, let me just say, you know, the recognition of my - you know, my art and talent by the Academy, it's - for me, it's really bigger than me. It's, like, every stylist's dream that's - you know, that sits behind a chair and want to work in motion picture or film. It's for the young child who tell their parent that they want to be a hairstylist, and the response is that is not a career, you know? This nomination to me is validation that hairstyling is an art form. And it is a craft, and it is a skill, you know? And I just think it shows every Black woman or man doing hair that we can achieve this nomination and more importantly, that our talent and skill is equal and exceptional, you know? This is just really mind-blowing to me 'cause hair is my passion. And to be nominated and to possibly win an award is just blows my mind. MARTIN: Well, congratulations. So great to talk with you. Jamika Wilson is nominated for an Oscar in the hair and makeup category for her work in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" which is streaming now on Netflix. Jamika Wilson, thank you so much for speaking with us, and good luck on Oscar night. WILSON: Thank you so much. LEWIS: (As Ma Rainey, singing) I want to see the dance they call the Black bottom. I want to learn that dance, want to see the dance you call your big Black bottom that'll put you in a trance. All the boys in the neighborhood - they say your Black bottom is really good. Come on and show me your Black bottom. I want to learn that dance. Copyright  2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

            "content": "Caron Nazario, a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, was driving to Petersburg, Va., from a drill weekend the night of Dec. 5 when he saw police lights flashing behind him. Too nervous to stop on a darkened road, Lieutenant Nazario, who is Black and Latino, drove about a mile to a gas station, pulled over and placed his cellphone on his dashboard, according to a lawsuit and video footage of the encounter. Immediately, two Windsor police officers can be heard yelling orders at him. Get out of the car, one yells as Lieutenant Nazario, remaining seated, repeatedly asks why he had been stopped and why the officers had drawn their guns. He positions his empty hands outside the window. Im honestly afraid to get out of the car, Lieutenant Nazario says. Yeah, says one of the officers, Joe Gutierrez, according to footage from his body camera. You should be. Seconds later, Officer Gutierrez doused the lieutenant with pepper spray. Lieutenant Nazarios hands remained up as he coughed and pleaded with the officers to undo his seatbelt and make sure his dog, Smoke, was not choking in the back. Liquid from the spray dripped down his hands and face. Lieutenant Nazario, 27, a graduate of Virginia State University, filed a lawsuit this month in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. It accuses the officers of illegally searching his car, using excessive force and violating his rights under the First Amendment. The lawsuit seeks $1 million in compensatory damages. Lieutenant Nazario also accused the officers of threatening to destroy his military career by charging him with multiple crimes if he complained about their conduct, according to the complaint, which was reported this week by The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk. Officer Gutierrez and the other officer named in the lawsuit, Daniel Crocker, did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. Chief Rodney Daniel Riddle of the Windsor Police Department did not respond to messages. The police force in Windsor, a rural town of about 2,700 people about 30 miles west of Norfolk, consists of six members: a chief, a first sergeant, a detective and three officers, according to the towns website. The police officers did not arrest Lieutenant Nazario and have not filed charges. In a report from that night the officers said they had pulled over Lieutenant Nazario because his S.U.V. did not have license plates. Lieutenant Nazario said he had recently bought a Chevrolet Tahoe and was waiting for license plates. Temporary ones had been taped inside the rear window and were visible, according to the lawsuit. The police report also said Lieutenant Nazario had willfully and wantonly disregarded police lights and sirens before pulling over, and was actively resisting when Officer Crocker attempted to open the S.U.V.s driver-side door. Lawyers for Lieutenant Nazario filed copies of video footage from his cellphone and from police body cameras that showed both officers approaching Lieutenant Nazarios vehicle at the gas station with their weapons drawn. Im actively serving this country and this is how youre going to treat me? he says in the footage. Whats going on? Lieutenant Nazario then asks. Whats going on is youre fixing to ride the lightning, son, Officer Gutierrez yells. (Later, after striking Lieutenant Nazario behind his knees, the officer told him to lay down or Im going to tase you, as the officers appeared to struggle to get Lieutenant Nazario on the ground.) After he was sprayed, Lieutenant Nazario began crying and cursing. After two volunteers from the towns emergency medical service arrived, Officer Crocker approached Lieutenant Nazario, who stood handcuffed near his S.U.V., and asked why he had not complied with their simple commands. What would have been a two-minute traffic stop turned into all this, Officer Crocker says in the footage. Im not out to hurt you and I know you dont want to hurt me. Lieutenant Nazario said that when the police had stopped him before he had made a point of pulling over in well-lit areas. I never looked out the window and saw guns blazing immediately, he tells Officer Crocker in the video. Officer Gutierrez later told Lieutenant Nazario that his chief had given him the discretion to let him go so long as the lieutenant did not fight and argue. Officer Gutierrez said he would not have to write a summons for obstruction of justice and failure to display a license plate if you want to chill and let this go. If he wrote a summons, the Army would have to be alerted, Officer Gutierrez told Lieutenant Nazario. Lieutenant Nazario said he would be alerting his supervisors about what had occurred. I get it, Officer Gutierrez says. The media spewing race relations between law enforcement and minorities, I get it. Lieutenant Nazarios lawyer, Jonathan Arthur, said the lieutenant had told his supervisors about the stop almost immediately. Hes still really shaken up, Mr. Arthur said. Hes very, very worried about retaliation."

            "content": "The first spring donor retreat after a defeat for a political party is typically a moment of reflection and renewal as officials chart a new direction forward. But with former President Donald J. Trump determined to keep his grip on the Republican Party and the partys base as adhered to him as ever, the coming together of the Republican National Committees top donors in South Florida this weekend is less a moment of reset and more a reminder of the continuing tensions and schisms roiling the G.O.P. The same former president who last month sent the R.N.C. a cease-and-desist letter demanding they stop using his likeness to raise money also served as the partys fund-raising headliner on Saturday night. A tremendous complication was how Fred Zeidman, a veteran Republican fund-raiser in Texas, described Mr. Trumps lingering presence on the political scene. The delicate dance between Mr. Trump and the party  after losing the House, the Senate and the White House on his watch  was evident in some actual shuttle bus diplomacy on Saturday, as the partys top donors attended a series of receptions and panels at the Four Seasons Resort before traveling to Mar-a-Lago, the former presidents private club, to hear Mr. Trump speak. The former presidents insistence on leading the party affects every member, Mr. Zeidman said, as lawmakers and would-be elected officials jockey for a Trump endorsement that was as powerful in a Republican primary as it could be problematic in a general election. Hes already proven that he wants to have a major say or keep control of the party, and hes already shown every sign that hes going to primary everybody that has not been supportive of him, Mr. Zeidman said. He complicates everything so much. Roughly 15 minutes into his speech Saturday night, Mr. Trump  after putting aside his prepared remarks  returned to his false claims that the election was stolen from him. He referenced Zuckerberg and $500 million spent on a lockbox from which, he said, every vote was marked, according to remarks described by an attendee. Biden. Saintly Joe Biden, he said, adding it was a rigged election. Mr. Trump praised loyalists like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff, while lashing his enemies  among them Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker; Michelle Obama, the former first lady; and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom he blamed anew for not helping to overturn Mr. Bidens win in the state. He saved much of his vitriol for Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, calling him a stiff and a stone cold loser, according to the attendee. A real leader, he said, would never have accepted the results of that election. Republicans, Mr. Trump said, according to the attendee, have to get tougher, they have to get meaner, they have to get better people. Among other things, Mr. Trump is considering running again in 2024. Though few of his allies believe he will follow through, his presence could have a chilling effect on other potential candidates. The party is still very much revolving around Mr. Trump, said Andrea Catsimatidis, chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party and a donor attending the retreat. He was the one who very much revived the party when we werent winning. Also inescapable is the fact that Mr. Trump has quickly built a political war chest that rivals that of the R.N.C. An adviser to Mr. Trump said he currently had about $85 million on hand, compared with nearly $84 million for the R.N.C. Send your donation to Save America PAC, Mr. Trump urged supporters last month, not to RINOS, the derisive acronym for Republicans in Name Only. Mr. Trump has appeared as passionate about punishing Republicans who crossed him, especially those who supported his second impeachment, as he has about taking back the House and the Senate in 2022. For party officials, the goal is keeping the energy that has propelled Mr. Trump to success inside the Republican tent while not entirely allowing the former president to dominate it. Ronna McDaniel, the R.N.C. chairwoman whom Mr. Trump supported for a second term, has vowed to remain neutral in a potential 2024 primary should Mr. Trump run again. It is a difficult balancing act, said Bill Palatucci, a Republican National Committeeman from New Jersey who has been critical of Mr. Trump. The president certainly has devoted followers, Mr. Palatucci said, but he also more than offended a lot of people with his conduct since the November election, which culminated in his helping to incite the riot on Jan. 6. Some donors are hoping to quickly move past Mr. Trump, but they are also focused on the current Oval Office occupant. It is very important the Republican Party puts Donald Trump as far into the past as possible, said William Oberndorf, an investor in California who has given millions to G.O.P. candidates but said he would now only give to Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach Mr. Trump. However, if Joe Biden does not ensure that major pieces of legislation have bipartisan support, it is he who will bear more responsibility than any group of Republican donors ever could for resurrecting Mr. Trumps political future and fortunes, he added. Among donors, the jockeying for favor and financing extends beyond Mr. Trump and the R.N.C. On Thursday and Friday, a separate but overlapping gathering for Republican contributors was held at Mr. Trumps private club: an investors meeting of the Conservative Partnership Institute (C.P.I.), a nonprofit organization. Mark Meadows, who served as Mr. Trumps chief of staff, is now a senior adviser for the group, and Caroline Wren, who used to fund-raise for the former president, is raising money for it. Donors are being pitched on a dizzying array of Trump-adjacent projects, including Mr. Pences group and new entities being started by Ben Carson, Mr. Trumps former housing secretary; Stephen Miller, his former White House adviser; and Russell Vought, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget. Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trumps first campaign manager in 2016, is said to be involved with efforts to start a Trump-aligned super PAC, as well. Mr. Trump, who continues to talk privately about a future campaign of his own in 2024, spoke to donors for the Meadows-linked group for more than an hour on Thursday, also at his private club. All Republican roads lead to Mar-a-Lago, said Jason Miller, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Trump is still the straw that stirs the news cycle. His influence will be central to every speech and story line this week. Those who have trekked there to meet Mr. Trump in recent months include Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former press secretary and a candidate for governor of Arkansas; Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee; and Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the House minority leader. In a suit and red Make America Great Again hat, Mr. Trump stopped by a fund-raiser for Ms. Sanders this weekend at his club. The R.N.C. had initially planned for its entire retreat to be held nearby in Palm Beach, but organizers moved the final Saturday evening events to Mr. Trumps resort, meaning the party will again be paying the former presidents private club to use its space. During Mr. Trumps White House tenure, his political campaign, the R.N.C. and his allies spent millions of dollars at Trump businesses, including his hotel in Washington near the White House and a resort property in Miami, where yet another pro-Trump group also held a conference this week. Party officials maintained that donors and a number of party activists were happier being at Trump-branded properties than they were anywhere else. Still, the Trump branding of official Republican events had alienated what was once the Republican establishment. This is all about the Trump circle of grift, said former Representative Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who is close to another high-profile Republican  and a frequent target of Mr. Trumps  who was also notably absent: Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Ms. Comstock said that the Republicans keeping their distance were wise to build their own coalitions and not get sucked into Trumpism, which has a limited and short-term appeal with demographics dying in this country. Henry Barbour, an influential R.N.C. member from Mississippi, said that the party was still in a transitional phase since Mr. Trumps loss. When you lose the White House, you kind of figure its going to take a little bit of healing, and I think probably first quarter has hopefully got us moving on a better path, Mr. Barbour said. Mr. Trump, he said, is a big force in the party, but the party is bigger than any one candidate including Donald Trump. With Mr. Trumps priorities differing from those of other party leaders, the tension remains palpable. On Friday, the super PAC for Senate Republicans, which is aligned with Mr.McConnell, announced its backing of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who infuriated Mr. Trump by voting to impeach him. (Some Trump 2020 advisers are working for Ms. Murkowskis Republican challenger, Kelly Tshibaka.) Last month, Mr. McConnell privately boasted of the super PACs fund-raising in a meeting with Senate Republicans, bragging that it had raised more than Mr. Trumps super PAC had in 2020. He even distributed a card to hammer home the point: In three cycles: nearly $1 billion, the card said. Below that were Mr. Trumps super PAC statistics: Trump: $148+ million, referring to the group America First. But the Republican small donor base remains very much enamored with Mr. Trump. Hell still be the most significant figure in the party in November 2022, predicted Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party and former chairman of the American Conservative Union. Everybody has a shelf life and Donald Trump has lost a bit of his shelf life. It could be two years, Mr. Cardenas added. It could be 10."

            "content": "KRASNIK, Poland  When local councilors adopted a resolution two years ago declaring their small town in southeastern Poland free of L.G.B.T., the mayor didnt see much harm in what appeared to be a symbolic and legally pointless gesture. Today, hes scrambling to contain the damage. What initially seemed a cost-free sop to conservatives in the rural and religiously devout Polish borderlands next to Ukraine, the May 2019 decision has become a costly embarrassment for the town of Krasnik. It has jeopardized millions of dollars in foreign funding and, Mayor Wojciech Wilk said, turned our town into a synonym for homophobia, which he insisted was not accurate. A French town last year severed a partnership with Krasnik in protest. And Norway, from which the mayor had hoped to get nearly $10 million starting this year to finance development projects, said in September that it would not give grants to any Polish town that declares itself free of L.G.B.T. We have become Europes laughingstock, and its the citizens not the local politicians whove suffered most, lamented Mr. Wilk, who is now lobbying councilors to repeal the resolution that put the towns 32,000 residents in the middle of a raucous debate over traditional and modern values. The situation also illustrates the real-life consequences of political posturing in the trenches of Europes culture wars. When Krasnik declared itself free of L.G.B.T., it was joining dozens of other towns in the region that had adopted similar measures with strong support from Polands governing right-wing Law and Justice party and the Roman Catholic Church. The declarations, part of the partys efforts to rally its base before a presidential election in 2020, did not bar gay people from entering or threaten expulsion for those already present. Instead they vowed to keep out L.G.B.T. ideology, a term used by conservatives to describe ideas and lifestyles they view as threatening to Polish tradition and Christian values. Cezary Nieradko, a 22-year-old student who describes himself as Krasniks only open gay, dismissed the term L.G.B.T. ideology as a smoke screen for homophobia. He recalled how, after the town adopted its resolution, his local pharmacist refused to fill his prescription for a heart drug. Mr. Nieradko recently moved to the nearby city of Lublin, where the regional council has also adopted a free of L.G.B.T. resolution but whose residents, he said, are generally more open-minded. Jan Albiniak, the Krasnik councilor who drafted the resolution, said that he had nothing personally against gay people, whom he described as friends and colleagues, and that he wanted to contain ideas that disturb the normal, regular way our society was functioning. He said he had drafted the resolution after watching an online video of abortion rights activists screaming at Christian men in Argentina. Although that had nothing to do with L.G.B.T. issues or Poland, Mr. Albiniak said the video showed that we are dealing with some sort of evil here and can see manifestations of demonic behavior around the world that must be stopped. In response to a rash of anti-L.G.B.T. resolutions across Polands heartland, the European Union, of which Poland is a member, as well as Norway and Iceland, have said they will cut funding to any Polish town that violates Europes commitment to tolerance and equality. The European Parliament also passed a resolution last month declaring all 27 countries in the bloc an L.G.B.T. Freedom Zone, although like the Polish resolutions declaring the opposite, the declaration has no legal force. All the posturing, however, has begun to have concrete consequences. Krasniks mayor said he worried that unless his towns free of L.G.B.T. status is rescinded, he has little chance of securing foreign funds to finance electric buses and youth programs, which he said are particularly important because young people keep leaving. My position is clear: I want this resolution repealed, he said, because its harmful for the town and its inhabitants. That will be an uphill struggle. Faced with the loss of foreign grants, several other Polish towns that declared themselves free of L.G.B.T. or adopted a family charter trumpeting traditional values have in recent months changed their mind. But the 21-member council in Krasnik, having voted last year against repeal, recently rejected an appeal by the mayor for another vote. Only one member has openly voiced a readiness to change sides. I made a mistake, said Pawel Kurek, who abstained on the original vote but now says the resolution was foolish and should be rescinded. On a national level, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of Law and Justice, told the newspaper Gazeta Polska last week that Poland must resist L.G.B.T ideas that are weakening the West and against all common sense. Underlying the stalemate in Krasnik are the political and demographic realities in a region where many young people have left to find work abroad or in Warsaw, the capital, and where the Catholic Church remains a powerful force. While many older people like their town being free of L.G.B.T., young people who have remained are appalled. Amanda Wojcicka, a 24-year-old convenience store worker, said the idea was embarrassing. But Jan Chamara, a 73-year-old former construction worker, said he would rather live on a diet of just potatoes than give into economic pressure from outside to repeal the resolution. I dont want their money, said Mr. Chamara, who said he had never seen gay people in Krasnik but still felt precautions were necessary. We will survive. Krasnik has acquired such notoriety that a French minister responsible for European affairs said he wanted to visit the town recently to show his opposition to discrimination during an official visit to Poland. The official, Clment Beaune, who is gay, called off the visit to Krasnik after what he described as pressure from Polish officials not to go, a claim that Polands foreign ministry said was untrue. When Krasnik and other towns adopted free of L.G.B.T. resolutions in early 2019, few people paid attention to what was widely seen as a political stunt by a governing party that delights in offending its foes political correctness. But that changed early last year when Bartosz Staszewski, an L.G.B.T. activist from Warsaw began visiting towns that had vowed to banish L.G.B.T. ideology. Mr. Staszewski, a documentary filmmaker, took with him an official-looking yellow sign on which was written in four languages: L.G.B.T.-FREE ZONE. He put the fake sign next to each towns real sign, taking photographs that he posted on social media. The action, which he called performance art, provoked outrage across Europe as it put a spotlight on what Mr. Staszewski described in an interview in Warsaw as a push by conservatives to turn basic human rights into an ideology. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has accused Mr. Staszewski of generating a fake scandal over no-go zones that dont exist. Several towns, supported by a right-wing outfit partly funded by the government, have filed defamation suits against the activist over his representation of bans on ideology as barring L.G.B.T. people. But even those who support the measures often seem confused about what it is that they want excluded. Asked on television whether the region surrounding Krasnik would become Polands first L.G.B.T.-free zone, Elzbieta Kruk, a prominent Law and Justice politician, said, I think Poland is going to be the first area free of L.G.B.T. She later reversed herself and said the target was L.G.B.T. ideology. For Mr. Wilk, Krasniks mayor, the semantic squabbling is a sign that it is time to drop attempts to make the town free of anyone or anything. But Mr. Albiniak, the initiator of the resolution, vowed to resist what he denounced as blackmail by foreigners threatening to withhold funds. If I vote to repeal, he said, I vote against myself.

            "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/us/black-lives-matter-fence-mural.html",
            "pub_date": "2021-04-10 22:22:16",
            "content": "The colorful mural, adorned with hearts, a portrait of a local activist and the words Black Lives Matter, stands out at a busy intersection in West St. Paul, a community nestled against the Twin Cities. It is a cherished symbol for many Black residents, a site of reflection and pride. But the city says it must go. I am totally saddened, said Kimetha Johnson, the activist depicted on the 75-foot fence, who last year became the citys first Black mayoral candidate. Its an awesome piece of art. The message is needed here. West St. Paul, where about 5 percent of the 20,000 residents are Black, says that the mural violates two sections of city code  about fences and prohibited signs  and that its specific content has nothing to do with the violations. The commotion over the mural comes at a pivotal moment in the Twin Cities area, which is anxiously awaiting a verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder in the death of George Floyd, who was Black. Thousands of residents spilled into the streets of Minneapolis, St. Paul and West St. Paul after Mr. Floyds death, demanding justice night after night in protests that reverberated around the country. About 200 National Guard members are stationed in the area while Mr. Chauvins trial unfolds; witnesses will return to the stand on Monday, the start of the third week of testimony. Ryan Weyandt, who owns the contested fence and the house it borders, received a notice from West St. Paul officials in November informing him that he was violating the citys sign ordinance. He reached an agreement to keep the mural, which was created with spray paints and acrylics last summer, in place until April 15. But the city denied an extension beyond Thursday and told reporters Mr. Weyandt could face fines of up to $2,000 for every 10 additional days the mural remains. Mr. Weyandt, who is white, said he had asked local museums if they might want to preserve the entire fence in their collections. If none accept, he will probably end up painting over the mural, an outcome he considers highly disappointing. We dont want to take it down before the trial is over, he said. We want that message to stay. Dan Nowicki, a spokesman for the city, said in an email that officials had received multiple complaints about the noncompliant fence, which breaches a part of city code that says fences must be one uniform color and feature no pictures or lettering. In its original notice to Mr. Weyandt, the city cited a code that bans signs painted, attached or in any other manner affixed to fences, roofs, trees, rocks or other similar natural surfaces. While the city understands the message on this particular fence is very important to the homeowner and many members of our community, Mr. Nowicki said, the city cannot and does not take content or message into account when dealing with infractions of city code. The scene around Minneapolis as the second week of the trial comes to a close. Takeaways from Day 10 of the Derek Chauvin trial. The police caused George Floyds death, but drugs and heart disease played a role, the medical examiner says. The notice Mr. Weyandt received also explained that during general election years, noncommercial signs are allowed in any size, in any number, in any location, except the public right of way  starting 46 days before the state primary election through 10 days after the general election in November. Such exceptions are common in Minnesota city ordinances and allow people to display almost anything they want, said Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. But once that time has passed, then the city or the town or whoever it is has a lot of discretion to establish restrictions, she said. Ms. Johnson, who goes by Kae Jae and received about 35 percent of the vote in last years mayoral election, said it was especially bad timing that the city was demanding that the mural be painted over in the middle of Mr. Chauvins trial. She said she liked to bring her 7-year-old granddaughter to the fence because of its powerful signal to Black girls. She literally loves to read out loud, Black Lives Matter, Ms. Johnson said, adding, For her, its seeing that the city has some type of pride about her. On Saturday morning, Guillermo Maldonado Prez, an assistant principal at a St. Paul school, and his 7-year-old daughter were admiring the mural. A petition in support of the painted message was circulating on Facebook, he said, but the request had seemed mostly to engage people from outside of the area. Hopefully, West St. Paul will change the way they allow people to express their values and their opinions, he said, noting the demonstrations on nearby streets after Mr. Floyd was killed in May. Mr. Weyandt, the fences owner, said he and his husband were simply hoping to project the Black Lives Matter message as best they could. They offered their fence as a canvas, hiring two artists who had worked on murals in the Twin Cities area. If one car stopped at the stop sign, looked at the fence and took that thought home, then our mission was accomplished, he said. Mr. Weyandt said that they had put messages and flags on the same fence several times before but that this was the first time the city had ever served them with a violation notice. One of the flags, which was hung up before 2020, proclaimed Coexist. Joshua Rashaad McFadden contributed reporting from West St. Paul, Minn."

Pushpika de Silva had just been crowned Mrs. Sri Lanka World at a pageant in Colombo, Sri Lanka, last weekend when Caroline Jurie, the 2020 Mrs. World winner, took the stage and announced that there is a rule that you have to be married and not divorced. So, she said, Im taking my first step saying that the crown goes to the first runner-up. Ms. Jurie, 28, then pulled the crown off Ms. de Silvas head, pulling her hair in the process, before placing it on the runner-up, who was holding back tears and later gave an acceptance speech. Ms. de Silva left the stage as Ms. Jurie, the two runners-up and Chula Padmendra, a Sri Lankan model who was also onstage, hugged. Ms. Padmendra applauded and raised her fist in the air victoriously. The scuffle was reminiscent of the one at the 2009 Video Music Awards, when Kanye West stormed the stage and grabbed a microphone from Taylor Swift, who had just won best female video, declaring: Im going to let you finish, but Beyonc had one of the best videos of all time. The Mrs. World pageant describes itself on Facebook as the first beauty pageant in the world for married women, created in 1984. Ms. Jurie was crowned Mrs. World at the 2020 pageant in Las Vegas, according to the organizations website. Ms. de Silva said in a Facebook post after the episode that she was separated and not divorced. She said she had sustained injuries to my skull and was pursuing legal action against Ms. Jurie for the injustice and insult that has taken place. The police arrested Ms. Jurie and Ms. Padmendra on charges of simple hurt and criminal cause, BBC News reported. Even though my crown has been snatched in front of everyone insultfully, I will keep my head straight, Ms. de Silva wrote. A representative for the Mrs. World organization, which is based in California, according to its Facebook page, referred a request for comment to where the incident occurred, in Sri Lanka. One of the pageants organizers, Chandimal Jayasinghe, told BBC News: We are disappointed. It was a disgrace how Caroline Jurie behaved on the stage and the Mrs. World organization has already begun an investigation on the matter. Ms. Jurie, who is Sri Lankan, said in a video posted on Instagram that she wanted to express my dismay over the recent actions that led to controversy and that she only wanted a fair stage. Even if I have to lose the crown for the values I stand for, I believe I am serving the purpose that the Mrs. World crown stands for, she said before taking off the crown."

            "content": "April 10, 2021, 3:09 p.m. ET New Hampshire and Oklahoma announced plans this week to open up vaccine eligibility to outside residents as supply grows and more states expand eligibility. Gov. Chris Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, said officials were confident that there would be enough shots to vaccinate outside residents by April 19, the same day that President Biden has called for every state to make all adults eligible for a shot. Mr. Sununu said New Hampshire was well ahead of that deadline after making all adults ages 16 or older in the state eligible for a vaccine on April 2. Were going to have a lot of vaccine here, he said at a news briefing on Thursday, so we want to get it out to anyone who might actually be here in the state. The change came after Mr. Sununu faced criticism from students and Democratic lawmakers for not allowing out-of-state college students to get vaccinated in New Hampshire. He said last week that residents had to come first and that college students were at lower risk compared with other age groups. About 47 percent of New Hampshires population of about 1.4 million has received at least one shot, the highest portion out of any state, according to a New York Times vaccine tracker. New Hampshire is behind some other states, though, in fully vaccinating residents, with about 22 percent completely inoculated. Oklahomabegan allowing outside residents to get vaccinated in the state on Thursday, nearly two weeks after the state made all adults ages 16 or older eligible. We have always known there would be a point at which supply and increasing capacity would allow us to welcome residents from neighboring states into Oklahoma to get vaccinated, Keith Reed, a deputy commissioner at the Oklahoma State Department of Health, said in a statement. We are now reaching that point. About 35 percent of Oklahomas population has received at least one shot, and 22 percent are fully vaccinated. Indiana also ended its residency requirement late last month. Dr. Kristina Box, the state health commissioner, said officials made the change to comply with Federal Emergency Management Agency vaccination site rules. The state also wantedto accommodate college students and residents who live with multiple people but may not have proof of residency. More than half of the states and the District of Columbia have residency requirements for vaccination, although most allow exceptions for out-of-state workers, according to a vaccine tracker from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on national health issues. The United States is administering on average about three million shots a day, an increase from roughly two million in early March. Although millions of Americans are getting vaccinated, the country is reporting a sharp rise in new cases, with an average of 67,923 new reported cases a day over the past week, according to a New York Times database. Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said more states are likely to follow New Hampshire and Oklahomas path as vaccine production ramps up. If a state does feel more secure in its supply and is not feeling a crunch, Dr. Kates said, then the ability to help the national effort to vaccinate more people and remove barriers becomes important. See where doses have gone, and who is eligible for a shot in each state."

            "content": "MIAMI  No one had to tell Ron DeSantis that his mock debates had bordered on disastrous. His answers rambled. He seemed uninspired. By the time he got to the greenroom of the biggest political stage of his career, a Republican primary debate for Florida governor in June 2018, he had made a risky decision. I thought about everything we did in debate practice, his campaign manager, Brad Herold, recalled Mr. DeSantis telling him. Im going to throw it out and do my own thing. At the debates start, the audience applauded louder for his better-known opponent, Adam Putnam. By its end  after he had cast Mr. Putnam as a vestige of old Republicanism and delivered a rat-a-tat of one-liners  Mr. DeSantis had taken command of the crowd. Nearly three years and a pandemic later, Mr. DeSantiss inclination to keep his own counsel and drive hard at reopening Florida has made him perhaps the most recognizable Republican governor in the country and a favorite of the party faithful. In turn, he has become a polarizing leader in the resistance to lengthy pandemic lockdowns, ignoring the advice of some public health experts in ways that have left his states residents bitterly divided over the costs and benefits of his actions. Now, with Florida defying many of the gloomy projections of early 2020 and feeling closer to normal as the pandemic continues to dictate daily life in many other big states, Mr. DeSantis, 42, has positioned himself as the head of the free state of Florida and as a political heir to former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. DeSantis owes a mightier debt than most in his party to Mr. Trump, who blessed his candidacy when he was a nobody congressman taking on the staid Florida Republican Party. Mr. DeSantiss political maneuvering and extensive national donor network have allowed him to emerge as a top Republican candidate to succeed Mr. Trump on the ballot in 2024 if the former president does not run again. The governors brand of libertarianism  or competent Trumpism, as one ally called it  is on the ascent. Seizing on conservative issues du jour like opposition to social media censorship and vaccine passports, he has forged strong connections with his partys base. And his bonds with Republican leaders may be deepening: Mr. DeSantis had a plum speaking spot on Saturday night at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trumps resort and political base in Palm Beach, Fla., for the Republican National Committees spring retreat. Other possible 2024 rivals, likeSenator Marco Rubio, were relegated to appearances a night earlier. We have too many people in this party who dont fight back, he told the gathering, according to audio obtained by The New York Times. You cant be scared of the left, you cant be scared of the media and you cant be scared of Big Tech. The governor has also taken steps to shore up his political standing around his handling of the pandemic, summoning reporters to the State Capitol on Wednesday to blast  complete with a slide-show presentation titled FACTS VS. SMEARS  a report in CBS Newss 60 Minutes that did not have sufficient evidence to prove a pay-to-play dynamic between Mr. DeSantiss administration and Covid-19 vaccine distribution for white and wealthy Floridians. His record on the virus is, in fact, mixed. By some measures, Florida has had an average performance in a pandemic that is not yet over. Yet his decisions helped keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. He highlights that he helped businesses survive and allowed children to go to school. What his critics cannot forget, however, is how he resisted some key public health guidelines. An op-ed article endorsing masks that his staff drafted under his name in mid-July was never approved by the governor for publication. The restrictions he now dismisses as ineffective, such as local mask mandates and curfews, which experts say in fact worked, were imposed in most cases by Democratic mayors with whom he hardly speaks. Given the ways people admire or despise him, however, the nuances seem beside the point. He infuriates passionate critics who believe he operates shrewdly to tend to his own interests. They fear that approach contributed to confusing public health messages, vaccine favoritism for the wealthy and the deaths of about 34,000 Floridians. DeathSantis, they call him. (Mr. DeSantis declined repeated interview requests for this article.) But at almost every turn, Mr. DeSantis has seized the criticism as an opportunity to become an avatar for national conservatives who relish the governors combativeness. He can score points that his potential Republican rivals in the minority in Washington, including Mr. Rubio and Senator Rick Scott, his predecessor as governor, cannot. Hes taken the wrong approach on some of our most critical issues, Covid being first and foremost, yet within Republican political circles, he is considered to be the front-runner for the White House, said former Representative David Jolly, an ex-Republican who is flirting with a possible run for governor. Hes worked his hand perfectly. Mr. DeSantis has raised his profile despite lacking the gregarious personality that might be associated with an aspiring Trump successor. Unlike the former president, no one would describe the publicly unemotional and not especially eloquent Mr. DeSantis as a showman. (After a record day of coronavirus deaths in July, he offered, These are tough, tough things to see.) People close to him describe an un-Trump-like fondness for poring over articles in scientific journals. And, they say, do not underestimate the intellect and instinct that have repeatedly defied expectations and propelled Mr. DeSantis from Little Leaguer in middle-class Dunedin, Fla., to potential presidential contender. He has a set of skills and traits that are ideal for the times, said former Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Republican who served in the House with Mr. DeSantis. Today, it would be very difficult to defeat him. He pronounces his last name DEE-san-tis. On the baseball field, he went simply by D. His team from Dunedin, on Floridas Gulf Coast, made it to the Little League World Series in 1991. He was a 12-year-old known to be serious and competitive. His father installed Nielsen TV-ratings boxes. His mother was a nurse. When he went to Yale, the Florida native  he was born in Jacksonville  arrived on campus in cutoff denim shorts. One of the reasons we got along is we werent the traditional, Ivy-League-mold students, said Nick Sinatra, a former Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity housemate. He always talked politics. Im a conservative, and at a place like that, thats not common. A history major, Mr. DeSantis lugged around a backpack full of books. He studied for both academics and athletics, scrutinizing ballplayers on TV. The Yale baseball team elected him captain. Prisoners have contracted the coronavirus at rates three times as high as others in the U.S. A Florida woman who coughed in a customers face last year at Pier 1 was sentenced to 30 days in jail. New Hampshire and Oklahoma are the latest states to open vaccinations to outside residents. His rsum got only more sterling. He spent a year teaching history at a Georgia prep school before landing at Harvard Law. He received a commission in the Navys Judge Advocate Generals Corps, where he served at Guantnamo Bay (not as a detainee, as an officer, he has quipped) and in Iraq. For two years, he worked as a federal prosecutor before winning a congressional seat near Jacksonville in 2012. His 2011 book, Dreams From Our Founding Fathers, which laid out a stridently conservative ideology, made him popular among Florida Tea Party Republicans. Two years earlier, he had married Casey Black, a local television anchor he met on a driving range. Ms. DeSantis would become one of her husbands closest advisers and biggest political assets, with an office at the State Capitol. They have three children under the age of 5; the youngest was born in March 2020. Mr. DeSantis said he was not in the delivery room so as to avoid using up precious personal protective equipment. The most memorable part of Mr. DeSantiss six years in Congress might be the platform they gave him to heighten his profile on Fox News, where he frequently represented the hard-line Freedom Caucus. Later, he would staunchly defend Mr. Trump over the Russia investigation. He was a policy wonk with an ability to really identify a few areas within his committees, responsibilities which he knew would give him the political opportunity to get on television, said Scott Parkinson, who was Mr. DeSantiss chief of staff in 2018. Mr. DeSantis was appearing on cable TV multiple times a day, Mr. Parkinson recalled. Mr. DeSantis often slept in his office and walked the Capitol halls wearing headphones, avoiding unwanted interactions. He made few friends and struck other lawmakers as aloof. A brief Senate run in 2016 proved critical: It exposed him to a national network of wealthy donors he would later tap in his long-shot bid for governor. Mr. DeSantis barely defeated Andrew Gillum, at the time considered one of the Democrats brightest stars, after a bruising campaign laced with accusations of racism. Determined to show his independence in his first months in office, he appointed a chief science officer and pledged billions for the Everglades. He pardoned four wrongfully accused Black men. He lifted a ban on medical marijuana in smokable form. He was hardly a moderate: Mr. DeSantis also gutted a voter-approved measure meant to restore felons right to vote. He allowed some teachers to carry guns in schools. He banned so-called sanctuary cities in a state where there were none. But the mix pleased voters, and his approval ratings surged. Might the man who had shown his diaper-age daughter building a wall in a campaign ad actually be a pragmatist? Then came the pandemic. In a state where political consultants often become synonymous with their clients over time, Mr. DeSantis has cycled quickly through advisers. A close friend and transition deputy was Representative Matt Gaetz, who is now embroiled in a scandalous federal investigation. Mr. DeSantis centralized power in his office early in the pandemic, ceding little of the spotlight to public health officials. The state Department of Healths weekly Covid-19 recaps are titled Updates on Floridas Vaccination Efforts Under Governor DeSantis Leadership. Mr. DeSantiss slowness in locking down the state last year hurt his approval ratings. So did a deadly summer surge of the virus. But then, far earlier than most other governors, he pledged that schools would open in the fall and life would start returning to normal. His policies were contrarian, and he was defiant, said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who has tracked Mr. DeSantiss popularity and saw it rebound beginning last summer. The more he stands his ground, the more he speaks his mind, the more the affinity grows for him. His critics see the governor as stubborn and unwilling to hear dissent. The governor we have today is the governor we anticipated after the election, said Nikki Fried, Floridas agriculture commissioner and the only Democrat elected statewide, who looks likely to run against Mr. DeSantis. He surprised everybody in 2019, she added, but obviously that is not truly who he is. In some ways, Mr. DeSantis has filled the void left by Mr. Trump, minus the tweets. He remains a Fox News regular. He counts among his scientific advisers Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the former Trump adviser who has promoted dubious theories. Mr. DeSantiss office said he had received a vaccine last week but not in public, reminiscent of Mr. Trump, who was given the shot behind closed doors. And the governors favorite foes are the corporate media, against whom he has scored political points. His recent tangle with 60 Minutes centered on the extent to which political connections have helped white, wealthy Floridians get vaccinated. Local news outlets have chronicled how vaccine access has been slower for Black, Latino and poorer communities. Some pop-up vaccination sites were opened in neighborhoods that had many older residents  and that also had ties to DeSantis campaign donors. But 60 Minutes focused on how Publix supermarket pharmacies received doses and left out relevant details, including an extended response from the governor at a news conference. On Wednesday, in Mr. DeSantiss words, he hit them back right between the eyes, accusing 60 Minutes of pursuing a malicious narrative. He left without taking questions.

The sheriff, Rosie Rivera, said the deputy who was shot in the face was in stable condition and the other was in critical condition. The gunman was dead but Sheriff Rivera did not specify how he died. She said the altercation took place on a grassy area outside the office, where it is common to find individuals sleeping or waiting for a bus. The two deputies were performing a routine security check around the campus when they saw the gunman, who was armed, Sheriff Rivera said. We dont know if he was asleep or not, but something occurred to get their attention to go talk with him, and then it happened very quickly, Sheriff Rivera said, adding that the deputies and the man exchanged gunfire. These types of incidents are really devastating for the department, and we hope and we pray that our deputies will be OK, the sheriff said at a news conference. The environment for law enforcement right now is extremely dangerous. Both deputies were expected to survive their wounds. The deputy in stable condition, whose cheek was grazed by a bullet, was expected to be released from the hospital shortly, the sheriff said. Theres quite a bit of damage on his face, but hes coherent, she added. The deputy in critical condition was expected to need surgery, Sheriff Rivera said. Gov. Spencer J. Cox of Utah said on Twitter that he and his wife were praying for the deputies. Mayor Jenny Wilson of Salt Lake County also offered support for the deputies and the department on Twitter. My thoughts are with the deputies who were injured in a horrific shooting this morning, Ms. Wilson said. Our hearts and hopes are with the deputies and their families. The two deputies were part of a team that oversees campus security surrounding the office and the nearby Salt Lake County Metro Jail, which are in South Salt Lake, Sheriff Rivera said. The deputies and the gunman were not immediately identified, but the sheriff later said the suspect was a man. Sheriff Rivera said that the authorities planned to review surveillance video, but that deputies who work in the jail do not wear body cameras. After the shooting, which happened around 10:30 a.m. local time, Sheriff Rivera said the jail went into a lockdown. Some nearby streets were also shut down. We dont have any indication that the jail is in any danger at all, she said, adding that lockdowns are standard protocol in such cases. In a follow-up news conference, Sheriff Rivera said she was thankful the encounter happened on a Saturday, when there are fewer employees are on the campus. This is our working place, she said. This is our working home, and it hit close to home. Peer-support teams were being made available to help county workers and the families of those involved, and neighboring police departments were offering help as well, the sheriff said. This is just shocking, she said. Were a strong family, and well make it through this. Its just tough right now for all of us. Sheriff Rivera said she had been in contact with the governors office and the mayors office, and added the multiple police agencies had reached out to show support. Law enforcement sticks together in these types of things, Sheriff River said. Its tragic, but well be OK and it could have been a lot worse."

            "content": "Ramsey Clark, who championed civil rights and liberties as attorney general in the Johnson administration, then devoted much of the rest of his life to defending unpopular causes and infamous people, including Saddam Hussein and others accused of war crimes, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 93. His niece Sharon Welch announced the death. In becoming the nations top law enforcement official, Mr. Clark was part of an extraordinary father-and-son trade-off in the federal halls of power. His appointment prompted his father, Justice Tom C. Clark, to resign from the United States Supreme Court to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest involving cases in which the federal government might come before that bench. To fill Justice Clarks seat, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall, who became the first African-American to serve on the Supreme Court. Mr. Clark, a tall, rangy man who shunned a government limousine in favor of his own beat-up Oldsmobile, set an ambitiously liberal course as attorney general. Days after taking office, he filed the first lawsuit to force a school district  Dale County, Ala.  to desegregate or else lose its federal school aid. He went on to file the first voting rights and school desegregation suits in the North. Under the limited laws then available, Mr. Clark sued to prevent employment discrimination. He oversaw the drafting of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1968  better known as the Fair Housing Act  which addressed housing discrimination. He sued to prevent discrimination in employment. He also ordered a moratorium on federal executions and prison construction; banned wiretaps in criminal cases; and refused to enforce a law that was intended to countermand the Supreme Courts restrictions on the questioning of criminal suspects under the so-called Miranda law. Mr. Clark became such a liberal lightning rod that Richard M. Nixon, in his 1968 presidential campaign, repeatedly won applause by vowing to fire him. Indeed, Nixon had made him such an issue in the campaign that President Johnson blamed Mr. Clark, with whom he had had an almost fatherly relationship, for Nixons slim victory over the Democratic candidate, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. After the election, Johnson stopped speaking to Mr. Clark and did not invite him to his final cabinet luncheon. With Nixon in the White House, Mr. Clark went into private legal practice and soon devoted more and more of his time to representing the disadvantaged and the unpopular, including Alaskan Natives, war resisters, rioters at the Attica prison in New York State and Lyndon LaRouche, the perennial presidential candidate and conspiracy theorist. He went beyond lawyering. In 1972, with the war in Vietnam dragging on, Mr. Clark met with Communist officials in Hanoi, the capital of North Vietnam, and publicly criticized American conduct of the war. That began a pattern: In 1980, months after Iranian revolutionaries had attacked the United States Embassy in Tehran and taken Americans hostage, he went to that city with nine other Americans, in violation of a travel ban, to help resolve the crisis and participate in a conference in which he criticized the United States for having supported Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before he was deposed. Six years later he met with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and denounced United States airstrikes against that country. In November 1990, as the United States prepared for the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Clark, who had criticized the American deployment of forces in the gulf, consulted with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The next year he filed a complaint with the International War Crimes Tribunal accusing President George Bush of war crimes. In 2011, he condemned NATOs bombing campaign against Qaddafis government. In 2013, he said Iran had no intention of building a nuclear bomb and denounced sanctions against that country. Later, he protested lethal attacks by unmanned American drone aircraft on other nations. Mr. Clark defended these trips and these statements, saying that a citizens highest obligation was to speak up when his government had violated its own principles and not point the finger at someone else. Saying that everybody deserves the best defense counsel, Mr. Clark lent his legal talents to Hussein as well as Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslavian president accused of war crimes; a Rwandan pastor accused of abetting a massacre; the former boss of a Nazi concentration camp; and Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. His critics contended that he was in effect supporting the forces of evil, not the standards of justice. John B. Judis wrote in The New Republic in 1991 that Mr. Clark had turned into a legal 911 for a tawdry collection of accused terrorists and neo- or ex-Nazis and that he had gone far beyond representing them in court. Nevertheless, in 2008, the United Nations General Assembly awarded Mr. Clark its Prize in the Field of Human Rights, which it gives every five years to human rights defenders. The U.N. commended him for speaking out against abuses by the United States in its campaign against terrorism. Past recipients included Eleanor Roosevelt, Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. William Ramsey Clark was born on Dec. 18, 1927, in Dallas to Judge Clark and Mary (Ramsey) Clark, whose father was a justice on the Texas Supreme Court and head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. (She lived to 100, dying in 2002.) Ramsey spent his early years in Los Angeles and later remembered becoming fiercely opposed to capital punishment in the fifth or sixth grade. Mr. Clark served in the Marines as a courier in Europe in World War II and graduated from the University of Texas. He earned a law degree and a masters in history from the University of Chicago. In 1949, he married Georgia Welch, a classmate at Texas. (She also earned a masters, in political science, at Chicago.) They had two children, Ronda Kathleen Clark and Thomas Campbell Clark I. Mrs. Clark died in 2010. Their son died in 2014. Ronda Clark was born deaf, epileptic and profoundly intellectually disabled, and Mr. Clark cited her many times as an inspiration for his humanitarian efforts. Ronda is our great joy, he said in an interview with The Dallas Morning News in 1996. But more than that, shes a great teacher. She has shown us the importance of patience, of discovery and love. His daughter survives him, as do a sister, Mimi Gronlund, and three granddaughters. Beginning in 1951 and for the next decade, Mr. Clark worked alongside cousins and uncles in a Dallas law firm. He lost only one case, and helped form the citys first legal aid society. In 1960, he worked on the presidential campaign of Senator John F. Kennedy, who, after he was elected, named him an assistant attorney general on the recommendation of Johnson, the new vice president and a longtime friend of the Clarks. At the Justice Department, Mr. Clark rode herd over litigation concerning preservation of natural resources. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy repeatedly sent him to the South to be a point man in the civil rights struggle there, not least because of his Texas drawl. Mr. Kennedy called him the preacher because of his opposition to Mr. Kennedys aggressive use of wiretaps to catch mobsters. In 1965, Mr. Clark was named deputy attorney general, the No. 2 job in the Justice Department under Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach. In that post, Mr. Clark was the chief federal government officer present at the Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights march in 1965. That same year he was appointed chairman of a task force that investigated urban unrest after the Watts riots in Los Angeles. He helped draft the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. He was named acting attorney general in October 1966, after Mr. Katzenbach left the Justice Department to be an under secretary of state. He was officially named attorney general the following March. The closest historical correlate to his fathers resignation from the Supreme Court to make way for him was when Charles Evans Hughes was appointed chief justice in 1930. His son, Charles Jr., then resigned as solicitor general, the lawyer who represents the federal government before the court. As the Vietnam War came to dominate the Johnson administration, Mr. Clark later said, the president was well aware of his opposition to it and expelled him from the National Security Council, where attorneys general often sit. But at other times Mr. Clark seemed to support the war. In 1967, he told the president that antiwar protesters had been infiltrated by Communists, the historian Robert Dallek wrote in 1998 in Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973. Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk wrote in his memoirs that he had sat next to Mr. Clark in cabinet meetings for years and had never heard him criticize the war. As late as 1968, while campaigning for Johnson in Wisconsin  before the president stunned the country by announcing that he would not seek the Democratic nomination again  Mr. Clark shouted at protesters, telling them that they should take their grievances to Hanoi. That same year, in Boston, he began the prosecution of five antiwar activists, charging the famed pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock, the Yale chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr. and three other men with conspiring to undermine selective service laws. Four of the so-called Boston Five were convicted, but two of the convictions were overturned on appeal. The remaining defendants, Mr. Coffin and the author Mitchell Goodman, were ordered retried, but the government dropped the case. Some have postulated that Mr. Clarks later radicalism grew out of a sense of guilt over this prosecution. Standing by, being attorney general during the Vietnam War without resigning, is not a particularly heroic position to have taken, Melvin Wulf, Mr. Clarks former law partner, said in an interview with The New York Observer in 2005. He wondered aloud if Mr. Clarks more recent, controversial actions represented atonement. In 2003, in the magazine Legal Affairs, David McReynolds, a longtime member of the War Resisters League, said he believed that Mr. Clark had been haunted by the prosecution of the Boston Five. Three years after that prosecution, Mr. Clark defended the Harrisburg Seven, antiwar activists led by the Rev. Philip Berrigan, the radical Roman Catholic priest. They were charged with 23 counts of conspiracy, including plotting to kidnap Henry A. Kissinger, then the national security adviser. The prosecution took five weeks to present its case. Mr. Clark, arguing for the defense this time, took just minutes to make his. Your honor, the defendants shall always seek peace, he said. They continue to proclaim their innocence. The defense rests. The jury deliberated for 59 hours before declaring itself hung. The entire case was later thrown out by a federal appeals court. Mr. Clark became an office seeker in 1974, when, as a Democrat, he tried to unseat Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York, a Republican. Holding to his principled positions, Mr. Clark often told voters what they did not want to hear. He advocated gun control legislation in speeches to hunters and told defense industry workers that their plants should be closed. He lost convincingly. He ran again for the Senate in 1976 but came in third in the Democratic primary behind Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the nominee, and Representative Bella Abzug. Mr. Clark was the author or co-author of several books, including The Fire This Time: U.S. War Crimes in the Gulf (1992) and The Torturer in the Mirror (2010), with Thomas Ehrlich Reifer and Haifa Zangana. The measure of your quality as a public person, as a citizen, is the gap between what you do and what you say. There are few better measures of the concern a society has for its individual members and its own well being than the way it handles criminals. A great many people in this country are worried about law-and-order. And a great many people are worried about justice. But one thing is certain: You cannot have either until you have both. A right is not what someone gives you; its what no one can take from you. Alex Traub contributed reporting."

            "content": "Marshall D. Sahlins, a brilliant and witty anthropologist who, starting in the 1970s, explored how individuals shape and are shaped by their cultures  a point he had already put in practice a decade earlier as the inventor of the teach-in against the Vietnam War  died on Monday at his home in Chicago. He was 90. His son, Peter Sahlins, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley, confirmed the death. Professor Sahlins had not fully developed his ideas about culture when, in March 1965, he and several colleagues from the University of Michigan gathered in his living room to discuss what they could do to oppose President Lyndon B. Johnsons escalation of the war. Some wanted to go on strike, a move that threatened to shut down the university and, Professor Sahlins worried, harm the students they were there to instruct. Instead, he said, taking a page from the sit-in protests of the civil rights movement, what if they set aside their syllabuses and gave lectures about Americas foreign policy, politics and history? Professor Sahlins called friends at Columbia, where he had received his Ph.D., and other schools, and within weeks faculty at dozens of campuses were holding teach-ins. In May 1965, Professor Sahlins led a national teach-in in Washington that received worldwide news media coverage. His activism didnt stop the war, of course. But the teach-in created an intellectual bridge between older leftists like Professor Sahlins and the budding activists of the baby boom generation. And as one of the earliest high-profile protests against Americas intervention in Vietnam, it set a template for future antiwar activism. It also signaled something of an intellectual turn for Professor Sahlins. Until then he had been a committed materialist, convinced that cultures evolved along with technological development. His undergraduate mentor at Michigan, Leslie A. White, was a leading figure in the effort to turn anthropology into something of a science; he even devised equations purporting to measure cultural evolution as a function of a societys ability to produce energy. But as the 1960s progressed, Professor Sahlins grew disenchanted with his mentors view, in part because it valorized Americas technologically advanced culture at a time when he was fiercely opposed to its military aggression in Vietnam. A Guggenheim fellowship in 1967 took him to France, where he encountered both the revolutionary activism of the French student movement and the work of the anthropologist Claude Lvi-Strauss. Mr. Lvi-Strauss was famous for his theory of structuralism, the idea that culture  not biology  was the central fact of human society, and that it could be analyzed by examining its symbolic structures. He also argued that so-called primitive societies were every bit as sophisticated as supposedly more advanced ones. Professor Sahlins agreed, and he remained a devotee of Mr. Lvi-Strauss for the rest of his career. He had one big problem with Mr. Lvi-Strausss approach, though: As the students demonstrating in the streets made clear, structures changed as they collided with reality, and the Lvi-Strauss framework had no way to account for that  it was, Professor Sahlins believed, fundamentally ahistorical. He joined the University of Chicago in 1973, and over the next two decades he worked out a form of structuralism that accounted for historical contingency and the actions of individuals. He summed up his ideas in his 1985 book, Islands of History, which includes a lengthy examination of Capt. James Cooks last visit to the Hawaiian Islands, in 1779. Professor Sahlins argued that the warm reception Captain Cook initially received, and his later death, coincided with the islanders belief in a banished god who would one day return, only to be defeated by their chief  in other words, that Cooks demise, inexplicable to Western eyes, made perfect sense within the islanders culture. Professor Sahlinss argument did not go unanswered. In what became a closely watched intellectual dispute, Gananath Obeyesekere, an anthropologist at Princeton, accused Professor Sahlins of creating a myth of conquest, imperialism and civilization by depicting the Hawaiians as nave and gullible; instead, he insisted, they would have seen Cook as merely a man, just as Westerners would have. Never one to shirk a fight, Professor Sahlins hit back with a book-length retort, How Natives Think: About Captain Cook, for Example (1995). Professor Obeyesekere, he charged, was the real imperialist for denying the uniqueness of the islanders culture and insisting that they adhered to a universal rationality  one that just happened to be the Western view of the world. It is difficult for the nonspecialist to judge whether he or Mr. Obeyesekere is right about Captain Cook and the Hawaiians, Richard Bernstein wrote in The New York Times. But at least until Mr. Obeyesekere replies, Mr. Sahlins appears to have won a decisive round in an academic boxing match. Professor Sahlins wrote prodigiously  15 books and dozens of articles in academic journals  but he never dropped his political activism. He was instrumental in forcing the University of Chicago to close its branch of the Confucius Institute, a China studies program that he said was little more than a propaganda arm of the Chinese government. In 2013 he took the rare step of resigning from the National Academy of Sciences, because of both its support of military research and its offer of membership to Napoleon Chagnon, an anthropologist whose work Professor Sahlins found reductive and dangerous. Those reasons were two faces of the same demon he had been fighting in both his political work and his academic career. Chagnons view of self-aggrandizing human nature is the sociobiological equivalent of the neocon premise of the virtues of American imperialism: making the world safe for self-interest, Professor Sahlins said in an interview with Dissent magazine. A huge ethnocentric and egocentric philosophy of human nature underlies the double imperialism of our sociobiological science and our global militarism. Marshall David Sahlins was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Chicago and grew up on the citys West Side. His father, Paul, was a doctor, and his mother, Bertha (Scud) Sahlins, was a homemaker. He graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in anthropology in 1951, the same year he married Barbara Vollen. She and their son survive him, as do two daughters, Julie and Elaine Sahlins, and three grandchildren. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1954 and became an assistant professor at Michigan in 1957. Despite later moving to the University of Chicago, he never abandoned his love for Michigan, or its football team: When he received an honorary degree from the university in 2001, he asked that the ceremony take place on the 50-yard line of its football stadium. Though his writing could be extremely dense, Professor Sahlins was famously quick-witted, a quality he shared with his brother, Bernard Sahlins, a founder of the Second City comedy troupe in Chicago. In 1993, the two wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times mock-protesting a recent column in which Russell Baker had claimed that his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, was the least fun college in the country  even though a recent poll had given that unwanted accolade to the University of Chicago, where Marshall taught and Bernard had studied. We are unmoved to tears by his reminiscences, they wrote, of watching only second-rate striptease acts in Baltimore bars or getting kicks from a parody of a mathematics professor demonstrating the solution of a calculus problem. Such antics, they added, testify to a degree of Philistine frivolity inconceivable at Chicago. Professor Sahlins could be equally cutting about his own achievements. During an interview at the Chicago Humanities Festival in 2013, he was introduced as the greatest living anthropologist. If Im the greatest living anthropologist, he said, then longevity must be a good career move."

            "content": "LONDON  Buckingham Palace said on Saturday that Prince Harry would be returning to Britain for Prince Philips funeral next weekend, setting in motion fevered speculation about whether the reunion would mend fences in the royal family or sow deeper discord. The visit, Harrys first since stepping down as a senior royal last year, will force a meeting with his brother, Prince William, and father, Prince Charles, who Harry said in an explosive interview last month were trapped in an unhappy palace life. But Harry will travel without his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who palace officials said would remain at the couples California home on doctors orders because she is in the latter stages of pregnancy. For weeks, while the world awaited Oprah Winfreys interview last month with Harry and Meghan, the eyes of many Britons were fixed on the health of Philip, Harrys grandfather, who had been hospitalized with a heart condition. Newspapers pictured Prince Charles in February leaving the bedside of Philip, his father  the sons eyes bloodshot as he was driven away. Harry and Meghan were castigated for comments about leaving their royal roles that detractors saw as ill-mannered in light of Philips illness. Have They No Respect? the Daily Mail screamed. That period of national concern over Philips health lent the royal family sympathy during an unusual dust-up within the institution, one that pitted brother against brother as Harry, in the interview with Ms. Winfrey, accused his family of racism and emotional abandonment. With that conflict still raging, Philips death on Friday at age 99 opened a new and uncertain chapter in the turbulent life of the House of Windsor. Among the first acts of the post-Philip era was the announcement that Harry would attend his grandfathers funeral, scheduled for April 17, a slimmed-down ceremony that palace officials said would be limited to 30 people. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain will not be among them: Wishing to avoid taking a family members seat, Mr. Johnson will not attend, his office said on Saturday. No question was more on the minds of royal watchers than whether Harry would make peace with his brother, Prince William, after a monthslong feud. Harry will come home, and a meeting between the brothers and perhaps, with luck, a reconciliation over their dead grandfather could be a possibility, said Penny Junor, a royal historian. Or not. Its going to go one way or the other, Ms. Junor said. Theres a sort of war going on within the family, and being played out in public. Its been everything the family doesnt want. The heating up of those tensions during Philips hospitalization created an awkward split screen, which defenders of Buckingham Palace used to attack Harry and Meghan for doing anything that could detract attention from the patriarchs health. In her interview, Meghan referred to Philips illness after Ms. Winfrey had asked about regrets. She said she had awaked that very morning to a note saying that Philip had been hospitalized. Nevertheless, she and Harry offered a painful account of their life within the Firm, the family institution that Philip spent much of his life trying to preserve. They said members of the family had expressed concern about how dark the skin of the couples then-unborn child, Archie, would be. Meghan said her efforts to seek mental health treatment had been rebuffed by palace officials, who worried about potential damage to the monarchy. The comments reverberated through Britain, touching off frank conversations about racism and the countrys colonial legacy. Philips own history of bigoted remarks was often cited as an example of anachronistic attitudes that were said to prevail within the family. So concerned was Harry about how the interview would affect Philip and Queen Elizabeth II that he got in touch with Ms. Winfrey shortly after it aired. He wanted to make sure I knew, and if I had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations, she told CBS News, referring to the comments about Archies skin color. The interview hardly featured in the wall-to-wall coverage of Philips death on British news stations on Friday. And for some in the country, it was a time for leaving the royal turmoil of recent months behind them. Obviously, there was so much scandal around the Meghan and Harry thing, said Lottie Smith, 18, who heard about Philips death on a train ride into London on Friday and came to Buckingham Palace to pay her respects. I think his passing will sort of leave that alone now. Her friend Catherine Vellacott, 19, chimed in with the hope that it would maybe unite the nation more. That was how Prime Minister Boris Johnson saw it, too. He cast Philips death on Friday as a reminder of the glue that has kept Britain stuck to its monarchy for so long. Like the expert carriage driver that he was, Mr. Johnson said of Philip outside Downing Street, he helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life. Even so, the biggest test of whether Philips death can reunify his warring family seems likely to come at his funeral. Befitting Philips preference for avoiding undue fuss, as well as Covid-19 restrictions on large gatherings, he will not lie in state, a ceremony at which the public would have been allowed to view his coffin. The 30-person limit at his funeral, at St. Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle, was in keeping with government restrictions, forcing the paring back of a guest list that would normally have run to several hundred people. Palace officials said on Saturday that his coffin would be carried through the castle grounds in a Land Rover. Plans for the televised ceremony, approved by Philip several years ago, had been scaled down because of the pandemic, they said. The procession will be joined by members of the royal family, along with military personnel. On Saturday, gun salutes marking Philips death were fired from cities across the four nations of the United Kingdom and at sea, a tradition dating back centuries. In London, among the weapons fired were 13-pounder field guns from World War I, the same fired at the wedding of Philip and Queen Elizabeth II in 1947. Prince Charles also offered a video tribute to his father. My dear papa was a very special person who I think, above all else, would have been amazed by the reaction and the touching things that have been said about him, he said in the tribute, filmed from his home in Highgrove in southwestern England. During Philips service in the British Navy during World War II, he was credited with hatching a plan in 1943 that saved his crew members lives as they came under fire from German bombers. As for Harry, he told James Corden, the talk show host, in late February of video chats with his grandfather and Archie during lockdown when Philip, instead of pressing the red button at the end of the call, would slam down the lid of the laptop. Travelers to England face mandatory self-isolation periods, although people can shorten them with private coronavirus testing. Harrys representatives said that he would follow the protocols. Few elements of the fallout between Harry and the rest of his family have pained Britons as much as his strained relationship with William, with whom he was once said to have a very close bond. If there is a coming together at the funeral, and the boys, the brothers, can speak to one another and forgive and forget, then I think theres some hope that Philips death may bring about an end to something that might otherwise have gone on for decades, said Ms. Junor, the historian, who wrote The Firm: The Troubled Life of the House of Windsor. But that hasnt happened yet, and it may not happen, she said. I certainly hope it does. Royal commentators suspect that even as Philip stepped back from his busy public schedule in recent years, he continued to play an active role in big issues facing the family, Harry and Meghans departure among them. If the queen is Britains head of state, commentators say, Philip was head of the royal household. He was credited with giving television cameras an early peek at the familys private life in the 1960s and introducing efficiencies at Buckingham Palace. Yet his stewardship of the royal household was not without difficulties. Known for cracking the whip, he wounded Charles, his oldest son, with frequent belittlements. And though Philip took it upon himself to steer the family through marital troubles, he was partly blamed for the palaces seemingly grudging response to an outpouring of grief over the death of Charless wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris in 1997.

            "content": "The request to much of the federal work force came from the Department of Health and Human Services, which is at the heart of a frantic effort by the Biden administration to keep up with a surge in young people crossing the southwestern border hoping to reunite with relatives already in the United States. The numbers are daunting. In March, border agents encountered nearly 19,000 children at the border  the largest number recorded in a single month  most of them fleeing poverty and violence in Central America. And the flow of migrant children is expected to only increase in coming weeks. More than 20,000 children and teenagers are in the custody of a government system that is already at 103 percent of capacity, including nearly 17,000 in shelters run by the health department, according to briefing materials from Operation Artemis, a response to the border crisis led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Government projections obtained by The New York Times show there could be more than 35,000 migrant children to be cared for by June  a prospect that one former senior health and human services official called terrifying. The ability of the Department of Health and Human Services to build shelters, move children quickly into them and then unite them with relatives and other sponsors in the United States is the first major test of whether the Biden administration can respond swiftly and effectively to a growing immigration crisis that has far-reaching political and human ramifications. The pressure is producing tension inside the White House. President Biden expressed frustration with Xavier Becerra, his new secretary of health and human services, in a White House meeting on March 30, for what the president views as bureaucratic holdups in increasing capacity, according to two administration officials familiar with the exchange. Susan Rice, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, and Amy Pope, the presidents senior adviser for migration issues, have been aggressively pressing officials from the health department and other immigration agencies for explanations about the failure to quickly move more than 4,000 migrant youths out of jail-like detention facilities run by Border Patrol, according to several people familiar with the meetings. When they first cross the border, unaccompanied children and teenagers are taken to border jails. By law, they are supposed to be held there for no more than three days before being moved to about 150 shelters and other facilities and group homes overseen by the Health and Human Services Department. But because of a lack of available space in the shelters, the young people are often being held for far longer in the often-harsh conditions of the border facilities. When they eventually are shipped to the health departments shelters around the country  where they are required to receive schooling, medical care, psychological services and recreation while officials vet family members, friends or foster parents who can take them in  they typically face further long waits. Despite inheriting a broken immigration system decimated by four years of neglect and poor policy decisions, the Biden administration continues to remain focused on expanding capacity and bed space, said Vedant R. Patel, a White House spokesman. The images of cramped cells full of teenagers and toddlers in border jails intended for adults are the direct result of an urgent lack of space in shelters that were originally meant as short-term facilities but during other immigration surges have typically ended up housing migrant children for at least a month and often longer. The latest surge, on pace to be larger than those that prompted crises for President Barack Obama in 2014 and 2016 and for President Donald J. Trump in 2019, has administration officials racing to erect facilities and recruit staff for them. Officials have opened a dozen emergency shelters in vacant spaces like convention centers in Dallas and San Diego, an expo center in San Antonio, and a military site and a former camp for oil workers in Texas. They have also moved to cut the time it takes to conduct background checks for parents in an effort to release the young migrants from the shelters more quickly and open up spots for those being held in border jails. But even with the early signs of progress, over 4,100 minors were stuck in border facilities earlier this week, far more than the 2,600 detained in border jails at the peak of the surge in 2019. Republicans have seized on the issue to claim that Mr. Biden did not act swiftly enough to expand the shelter system even as he focused on unwinding his predecessors restrictive border policies. A flurry of executive orders issued weeks after Mr. Biden took office targeted other parts of his immigration agenda, including reviewing the Trump administrations policies that limited asylum and halting border wall construction. And the president waited until March to call on FEMA to assist in the effort to find shelter space for the children, after the number of minors stuck in border jails surpassed 3,000. Former health officials under Mr. Trump  whose policies were intended to make conditions for migrants at the border bad enough to deter more people from coming  said they had pushed during the last two years of his administration to expand the number of available beds for migrant children and to reduce the amount of time that children spend in the departments care. Two senior former officials said that by the time Mr. Trump left office, the department was on track to expand the systems ability to deal with further surges by adding thousands of beds over time that could be quickly activated in an emergency. The United States has the capacity to be compassionate, said Lynn Johnson, the former assistant secretary of the health departments Administration for Children and Families under Mr. Trump. But were not compassionate when we dont have a process in place and we let whats happening, happen. We have got to fix this. Aides to Mr. Trump said career officials warned the incoming Biden team of the likely surge of arrivals in the spring, but said the new administration did not move quickly to begin reactivating emergency facilities for added space. Biden administration officials reject that criticism, saying they were not given enough information during the transition and they notified Congress of the need to begin adding emergency capacity in early February. They said they were also hampered by a decision by Trump administration officials during the pandemic to freeze hiring at the health departments Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the shelters. And they accused their predecessors of merely relying on the existence of Mr. Trumps harsh policies that blocked migrants from entering the country. They were turning away unaccompanied migrant kids so they were not taking efforts to expand the shelter system, said Cecilia Muoz, one of Mr. Bidens top immigration officials during the transition. With the permanent shelters out of space, the administration is increasingly turning to temporary spaces that are more like hurricane shelters, with cots rather than beds and few of the more school-like services that the health department offers at its licensed facilities. Mr. Bidens aides are scouting additional locations, including a convention center in Long Beach, Calif., and a Navy boot camp in Illinois. Officials are also planning on expanding the number of tent camps attached to the border jails. Government documents show the administration also still needs to ramp up hiring of medical officials and case managers. A briefing memo sent to administration officials this week directed the health department to identify and deploy all available federal volunteers to support the effort to address the increase of minors, a drive reflected by the email seeking government workers to help. As of Friday, 2,722 employees across the government have volunteered, in most cases with their salaries being picked up by the health department. Some are caring for children at shelters. Others are helping with case management, I.T. services, food delivery, transportation and other logistics. Officials said hiring for the shelters was often a challenge because the care of migrant children has become a highly charged, political issue, with critics often making no distinction between Border Patrol jails and the health departments shelters. Government contractors who run many of the shelters on behalf of the government have struggled to find staff willing to endure criticism. And the intense immigration debate has made it harder to recruit foster parents. Chris and Kristen Umphlett, who have welcomed migrant children to their home in Lansing, Mich., since last year, said the requests for help from organizations working on behalf of the government were becoming more urgent as the crisis worsened. Theyve made explicit asks. Do you know anyone? Tell people about this. Refer people to us, said Mr. Umphlett, a data analyst at a software company. Part of the problem is they need to get people into the funnel of qualifying for foster care. The United States has long struggled to quickly move children out of the governments care to make room for new arrivals. Most are eventually matched with a parent who is already in the country. But others are handed over to more distant relatives, friends or foster parents. The more distant the connection, the longer the children are typically held in the shelters while health officials do background checks to ensure their safety. Of the roughly 2,000 minors released to sponsors in the past week, about half were reunited with parents or legal guardians after an average of 23 days. Those with more distant relatives had to wait on average nearly two months. Health department officials acknowledged that the vetting process was arduous. Officials require the families, many with limited English, to provide specific documents proving their relationship and to send in fingerprints of certain relatives for background checks. The administration has made efforts to streamline that process, rescinding a Trump-era program backed by Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr. Trumps immigration agenda, which had sought to determine legal status of relatives before children could be placed with them. Under Mr. Millers policy, the health department was required to share background check information on all adults in a childs prospective household with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which would then determine their legal status. Critics said the policy discouraged some relatives from coming forward to retrieve migrant children from the health department. Under Mr. Biden, the department no longer routinely shares the information with ICE and does not require such extensive background checks to other members of the household. But speed must be balanced with security concerns for the children, officials said, particularly after a 2016 Senate report revealed that more than a dozen immigrant children were forced into labor at an egg farm or placed into trafficking rings after the health department failed to conduct background checks of caregivers. From the outside it may not appear to be an ideal system but at its core it is one that emphasizes safety, which is critical when it comes to vulnerable children, said Krish Vignarajah, the president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps unite minors with sponsors. The Biden administration has made progress in recent days, bringing the number of minors in border detention facilities down by more than 1,000 from the height of 5,000 last month. But the internal documents show that to handle a surge that the administration has said will continue to grow into the summer, the health department will need to release more than 800 minors a day by June, compared with the roughly 300 children currently being released daily. Officials are also looking to reduce the flow of migrants from Central America, including children, with diplomatic outreach, new immigration programs and financial investment in the region. But Roberta Jacobson, a former ambassador to Mexico who has been spearheading diplomacy with the region, announced on Friday that she would leave the administration at the end of April as planned."

            "content": "For over a year, a special team of editors within The Wall Street Journal analyzed the state of the newsroom and produced a detailed, lengthy report on what the paper is doing right, and, more important, what the paper is doing wrong. The stakes are high. Subscriptions to The Journal are growing  but not fast enough. News Corp, the company that owns The Journal, wants the broadsheet to double its readership. The study, called The Content Review, concluded that that goal would be difficult without sweeping changes. The Journal, it said, needs to rethink how it gathers news, what kinds of topics it covers and who its audience is. The report was intended to serve as a blueprint for how the paper should remake itself for the digital age and insure its future. But the company has effectively shelved the report, which was completed last summer; most people in the newsroom have not seen it. What follows are some of the specific findings. Change is hard in any news organization. In the case of The Journal, the barrier, we quickly found, was fear. The paper needs to overcome its anxiety and become an audience-focused newsroom, the report said, a step that many other papers and digital publishers have already taken. Catch up: Boeing tells airlines to stop flying some 737 Max planes. Lee Delaney, the BJs Wholesale Club chief executive, dies unexpectedly. The S.E.C. says it may be time to revisit the rules on SPACs. What The Content Review is about. The Journal needs to find better ways to connect with its audiences instead of relying on what the report calls its heavy readers, the hard-nosed executives, intense Wall Street traders and retirees who make up a bulk of its audience. Subsisting on this group alone has created a traffic ceiling. The paper cant seem to break the barrier of 50 million readers a month when it needs twice that amount. The Journal needs new readers  specifically, women, people of color and younger professionals. But reaching those people will be tough given the lack of focus on diversity within our coverage, according to the study. The report found that over a three-month period, of the 108 lead stories it published only one had race as the main topic. It added: None had gender as the main topic, and none had L.G.B.T.Q.-specific issues as the main topic of the story. As far as the protagonist of a story  many of our stories do not have human protagonists. But when they did, we found that 13 percent were people of color. A lack of digital expertise is an underlying problem, the report said. We need editors to more actively take into account Google Trends and Google Suggestions in story assigning and encourage people to do so within their beats and columns, it offered as an example. The bulk of this section also outlined specific recommendations, such as improving wellness coverage, while discouraging earnings stories, a category that often underperforms on page views. What The Journal should do, and what it shouldnt. The report laid out in stark terms how much more traffic and engagement each department will have to deliver to hit The Journals target of 100 million monthly readers. The report added that the paper needed to reach 55 million readers a month over the next year. Spread over its six main coverage areas  corporate, Washington, arts, finance, national, international  each department, it said, will need to bring in about 1.9 million more nonsubscribers above where we were last Fall. What editors at The Journal need to know."

            "content": "John Topping, whose work to warn the world of the risks of climate change stretched back to the 1980s, and who helped spur the international effort to limit warming, died on March 9 at a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 77. The cause was gastrointestinal bleeding, his daughter Elizabeth Barrett Topping said. A Rockefeller Republican, Mr. Topping took on the emerging climate crisis when fighting planetary warming was still a bipartisan issue. John was an early actor, said Rafe Pomerance, senior fellow at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts, who recalled Mr. Toppings ability to connect people who might not otherwise have had much in common. He brought a lot of interesting people to the table and got involved. As a Republican of solid credentials, Mr. Pomerance said, Mr. Topping reached out into places I had no access to. In a phone interview, Joe Cannon, who served as an Environmental Protection Agency official with Mr. Topping, called him very patient and said he had a gigantic understanding of things  bureaucracy in general, and environmental policy in particular. James Hansen, a former NASA scientist who introduced Mr. Topping to climate issues in 1982, recalled a special quality Mr. Topping had as an advocate: John was a jolly fellow, always upbeat and happy, even though he was working on what he knew was a serious problem. Dr. Hansen, who would become a prominent clarion of climate risk, said he first met Mr. Topping when the Ronald Reagan administration tried to cut his funding for research into carbon dioxide and climate change. Mr. Topping and Mr. Cannon got the research funded, but the gains were only temporary, Dr. Hansen recalled. Mr. Topping was disturbed to discover that, by his count, only seven people at the E.P.A. out of some 13,000 staff members were assigned to work on climate change and ozone depletion. Topping was frustrated with the administration, which wouldnt take climate change seriously, Dr. Hansen said, so he finally decided to form his own organization. The organization that became known as the Climate Institute is widely considered the first nongovernmental entity dedicated to addressing climate change. Mr. Topping served as its president until his death. Through the institute, he worked with the British diplomat Crispin Tickell on building a global partnership to deal with planetary warming, playing a part in the process that culminated in the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988. He also helped write sections of the panels first report, in 1990. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore. John Carruthers Topping Jr. was born on April 18, 1943, in Wilkinsburg, Pa., to John and Barbara Anne (Murray) Topping. His father was in the Air Force, and he had a peripatetic childhood that took the family to Scotland, Colorado, Germany, Maine, Japan and Massachusetts. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1964 with a bachelors degree in international relations and earned a law degree from Yale University in 1967. After serving in the Air Force as a legal officer in the Judge Advocate Generals Corps, he entered the federal government, working to promote minority-owned businesses at the Advisory Council on Minority Business Enterprise and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, part of the Department of Commerce, during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Topping would later join the Reagan administration, first at the presidential personnel office and then at the Environmental Protection Agency, where he served from 1982 until 1986, including two years as staff director of the Office of Air and Radiation. During his time at the agency, he threw himself into such efforts as removing lead from gasoline and establishing standards for particulate air pollution, as well as studying the risks of secondhand smoke. He married Linda Thompson in 1974. They divorced in 2000. In addition to his daughter Elizabeth, he is survived by a brother, Dr. Trexler Topping; a son, John C. Topping III; another daughter, Alexandra Van Beek; and six grandchildren. He saw solutions where other people just saw a problem, his ex-wife, Linda Thompson Gonzalez, who last year was a candidate for the Florida House of Representatives, said in an interview. She recalled that through the years, Mr. Topping was distraught over the lack of progress on climate change when the solutions are out there, right in front of you, and you fail to do the right thing. But when he did face those frustrations, he would take out his yellow pad, she said. He expressed his frustration by trying to come up with a solution and a compelling response. Mr. Toppings daughter Elizabeth remembered life in their busy household as charmed. He was a connector, she said. Dinners and parties at the Topping house brought together people with different ideas; disagreements were expected, but discussion was always fun and always respectful, she recalled. I didnt realize how unique that was. Elizabeth Topping said discussions with her father sometimes revealed aspects of his life she had not imagined. One day, she recalled, they were listening to Beatles records, and Mr. Topping said, Oh, I met John Lennon once, with a few attorneys. It seemed that the Nixon administration wanted to deport Lennon, and Mr. Topping was one of the lawyers brought in to consult on the matter. His role in the case was minor, he told her, but she recalled him adding, It would have been much better if hed been deported  he may not have been killed. Mr. Cannon said, I think Johns defining characteristic is he did not have a speck of guile in him, adding, You dont expect that in Washington. But, he added, Mr. Toppings kind nature might have prevented him from being as effective as he could have been in that city, especially when those on the other side wielded guile to spare. He wouldnt say bad things about people, even when we were fighting really bad people, Mr. Cannon said. He didnt betray his principles to advance his interests."

April 10, 2021, 10:39 p.m. ET From Leonardo da Vincis pyramid design in the 15th century to thesupersonic version that helped land the Perseverance rover safely on Mars, the parachute, a device that catches air to control an objects speed, has played an essential role in land, air, water and space travel. For all of the technology and resources that go into launching a spacecraft out of Earths atmosphere, it is the simple parachute that is key to safely landing it. A parachutes canopy creates drag or air resistance, which means that the air below is pushed up against the underside of the canopy and slows its rate of descent. Now its your turn to make a parachute using newspaper and tape. Some tips: Be willing to make adjustments. Try varying the size of the canopy and the weight of the basket to see how those adjustments affect the rate at which the parachute falls. Let the basket hang freely so it can center itself. Open the canopy as much as possible before releasing, and use the lifting stick to get your parachute as high above your head as possible. Pull out the stick, stand back and watch the fundamental concept of drag at work. 1. Use a full double-spread sheet of newspaper and fold it in half and then in half again. 2. Fold the top left corner diagonally to meet the bottom fold. 3. Cut off the remaining strip and unfold all the pieces. 4.Fold and unfold the sheet so that all the creases are raised slightly. 5. Tape a strip to each bottom corner of your sheet, crisscrossing them, then tape to top corners. 6. Tape the strips together where they cross. 7. Finished canopy. 1. Use another full double-spread sheet of newspaper. Fold it into quarters and then unfold. 2. Cut out a quarter of the page along crease lines. 3. Fold quarter section in half short edge to short edge. 4. Place tape sticky sidealong short edge. 5. Roll loosely, secure with tape. 6. Flatten the base of cylinder; tape the layers together. 7. Finished basket. 1. Cut a strip approximately one inch wide along the short edge of the remaining sheet 2. Fold in half along the existing crease 3. Finished basket handle 1. Slip the basket handle under the crossed strips. 2. Place the basket upside down in the center. 3. Curvethe handle strip up, and tape to the sides of the basket. 4. Assembled upside down parachute with basket. 1. Use another double-page sheetof newspaper. Fold in half. 2. Place strips of tape along the long open edge of newspaper. 3. Start at the folded edge, roll tightly to tape. 4. Close the tube with tape. 1. Open the canopy, place the lifting stick at center. Lift as high as you can. 2. Quickly, pull lifting stick backward, away from the canopy to release it."

            "content": "The Directors Guild of America made history Saturday night, giving the groups top prize for feature-film directing to Chlo Zhao (Nomadland), the first woman of color to receive the award and only the second woman ever to win in the category, after Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker). Zhao was considered the heavy favorite after a dominant awards-season run for her film that has also included top honors at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards and Producers Guild Awards, and she will now enter Oscar night as the prohibitive front-runner, since the DGA winner has won the best-director Oscar 13 of the last 15 times. A best-picture victory for Nomadland appears increasingly likely, too: Few films have gone on to take Oscars top prize without first winning at the DGA or PGA. Still, one of those curveballs came just last year, when Parasite won best picture without either of those trophies but after netting a high-profile win at the Screen Actors Guild. That may provide a path forward for The Trial of the Chicago 7, which also pulled off a SAG victory last week. But though that films director, Aaron Sorkin, was nominated alongside Zhao for the DGA Award, he was snubbed for a directing nomination at the Oscars.

And though he didnt win, Fincher may have gotten the line of the night when he was asked to sum up his career: Directing, Fincher said, is a bit like trying to paint a watercolor from four blocks away through a telescope, over a walkie-talkie, and 85 people are holding the brush.

            "content": "Maryland lawmakers voted on Saturday to limit police officers use of force, restrict the use of no-knock warrants and repeal the nations first Bill of Rights for law enforcement, taking sweeping action to address police violence after nationwide demonstrations following the death of George Floyd. The Democratic-led legislature enacted the changes by overriding Gov. Larry Hogans vetoes during a session in which some Black lawmakers read aloud the names of people they said had been killed by police officers in the state. The changes placed Maryland at the forefront of a national debate over police brutality and the use of excessive force, a discussion that has gained intensity since Mr. Floyd was killed in police custody last year, setting off protests across the country. The legislation was passed in the middle of the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who is accused of the murder of Mr. Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. This is what the community wants  they want reform, they want transparency, and they want accountability, said Caylin A. Young, public policy director of the A.C.L.U. of Maryland, which was part of a coalition of 90 groups that had backed the bills. There needs to be a reimagining of what policing in Maryland looks like. Mr. Hogan, a Republican, had vetoed the measures on Friday, saying their original intent had been overtaken by political agendas that do not serve the public safety needs of the citizens of Maryland. He said the changes would further erode police morale, community relationships and public confidence. Police groups also criticized the legislatures action. The reality is they have reinvented policing in the state of Maryland, said Angelo Consoli, second vice president and legislative committee chairman of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police. Theyre going to make it tougher for the police to police. Theres reform, and this went beyond reform. The wide-ranging changes were intended to address many of the concerns raised by demonstrators who have protested police violence after the deaths of Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black people killed by officers. One section creates a new statewide use-of-force policy and says that officers who violate those standards, causing serious injury or death, can be convicted and sent to prison for up to 10 years. The standard says that force can be used only to prevent an imminent threat of physical injury to a person or to effectuate a legitimate law enforcement objective. The policy also says that force must be necessary and proportional. Police reform groups said that was a tougher standard than the traditional reasonableness standard, which they said was not sufficient for holding officers accountable for blatant acts of violence. Mr. Consoli said the change would deter the police from intervening in volatile situations and open them to more Monday morning quarterbacking. In another change, law enforcement agencies statewide must establish a system to identify police officers who are considered likely to use excessive force and to retrain, counsel or, if needed, reassign them. The scene around Minneapolis as the second week of the trial comes to a close. Takeaways from Day 10 of the Derek Chauvin trial. The police caused George Floyds death, but drugs and heart disease played a role, the medical examiner says. The legislature also repealed Marylands Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, which was the nations first such law when it was enacted in the 1970s. It gave every officer statewide the right to appeal discipline to a local board, regardless of a citys wishes. Maryland lawmakers replaced those protections by requiring every county to have a police accountability board to receive complaints of misconduct from the public. Civilians will have a role on administrative charging committees that will review the findings of law enforcement agencies and recommend discipline for officers. Police chiefs will not be able to issue disciplinary actions more lenient than the level recommended by those panels. Lawmakers also limited the use of no-knock warrants, which gained nationwide attention last year after the police in Louisville, Ky., fatally shot Ms. Taylor when they were fired upon after breaking down her apartment door. Officers have said that they first announced their presence, but most witnesses disagreed. Other changes in Maryland include the requirement that, by 2025, all law enforcement officers who regularly interact with the public must wear body cameras. Officers will also be prohibited from preventing people from recording them, as long as that person is acting lawfully and safely. The bills also made some changes that the police consider favorable. Police officers will have whistle-blower protections and may engage in off-duty political activity and have the right to work at second jobs. Loan assistance and scholarship programs were established for officers who are attending college, and prior marijuana use will not be a disqualification for hiring. Adrienne Jones, the speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, said in a Facebook post on Saturday evening that the state was leading the country in transforming our broken policing system. Now, for the first time in our nations history, she wrote, the rights of officers will not be held above the rights of individuals, and policing in Maryland will be transparent and citizen-centered."

            "content": "Get-togethers are being planned without Zoom links. Restaurant diners are venturing back inside. As the vaccine rollout continues to gain speed, more companies are reopening their offices. Were officially heading into new times. From a wardrobe perspective, these developments have generally meant one thing: putting on non-stretchy pants again. Buttons and zippers and buckles are back, and with them more difficult decisions about what to wear to be seen in the world. After a year spent without such choices, this hasnt been the easiest transition for many. For those whove neglected their closets during the pandemic, returning to a full wardrobe can feel more like a confrontation than a homecoming. I feel like people need to be reintroduced to their closets again, said Allison Bornstein, a celebrity stylist who began offering virtual styling sessions to noncelebrities early in the pandemic  and last month was her busiest month to date. People are like: OK, its time to re-enter the world, and I need help. I have all this stuff, I dont know what I want to wear, and I dont like anything that I have, Ms. Bornstein said. Professional organizers have been fielding similar complaints. Pia Thompson, founder of the home organization company Sweet Digs, said she recently worked with a client who hadnt even glanced at her dresses in a year. Do I still want to wear any of these? the woman asked while they sifted through her closet. Spending parts of the last year in confinement has made people question their lifestyle  their social circle, their self-identity and now their wardrobe. If the world outside doesnt look the same anymore, why should they? People see this as a time to really figure out how they want to show up now, Ms. Thompson said. Figuring that out can mean embracing experimentation with your appearance. But in order to get there, experts agree, you must first purge. Get rid of the stuff that doesnt feel like it fits your lifestyle anymore., Ms. Bornstein said. Get rid of the stuff that youve never liked. Decluttering makes it so much clearer to see what it is that you actually want to wear. There are many approaches to the closet purge. Nikki Boyd, the author of Beautifully Organized, recommends starting by arranging your closet by category  tops, bottoms and so on  then sorting each category by color. Youre able to see things like, Why do I have 20 black shirts? she said. From there, Ms. Boyd suggested setting a few hard rules tailored to your needs. For example: No more than three of anything, including black shirts. Its just like anything else: no guidelines, no structure, she said. You get a thrill, your energy rises, you feel it in your heart as opposed to your head, said Ms. Thompson, a KonMari consultant in training, describing what youre supposed to be feeling when the response to joy is yes. The KonMari method generally starts with clothes, then moves on to books and papers before ending with sentimental keepsakes  the idea being that clothing is the easiest to discard and personal souvenirs are the hardest. Except thats not always true; clothes can carry as muchbaggage as mementos. When Rebekah Love found a pair of Levis jeans that fitperfectly, she wore them for years, until they eventually tore in the crotch. Even then she didnt want to let them go. She realized they represented a rare kind of understanding, she said. I found a brand that understands my body. Now, as a professional organizer, she encourages people who cling to unworn clothing to figure out why  to identify what those pieces really represent for them. She takes a holistic approach to organization, comparing mediocre outfits to unsatisfying relationships: If you were around somebody who didnt make you feel good about yourself, would you continue to hang out with them? Dont Just Discard. Donate. The pandemic has inflated a classic closet problem: holding onto things that no longer fit. A survey of more than 3,000 people by the American Psychological Association found that 42 percent of them gained more weight than they intended in the pandemic. Within this group, the average weight gain was 29 pounds, with a median gain of 15 pounds. The prevailing advice is to let go of these aspirational clothes. You reach for a pair of jeans that dont fit, and that just ruins your whole day, Ms. Bornstein said. If theyre not an option to wear at this moment, just get them out of there. Storing ill-fitting clothes in a suitcase or box is an option, however, if you expect or hope theyll fit again someday (though Ms. Kondo may not approve). If youre determined to keep these clothes in your closet, Ms. Boyd recommends tagging their hangers with a sticker. If you go six months without reaching for the tagged clothes, throw them out. But throw them out responsibly. Waste in fashion is a well-documented problem; a McKinsey report in 2016 found that for every five garments produced, the equivalent of three end up in a landfill or incinerated each year. Instead, used clothing can be donated to the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross or Goodwill. Job-interview-appropriate items for women can go to Dress for Success, and gently worn coats to One Warm Coat during the fall and winter months. Madewell turns used denim into housing insulation through the Blue Jeans Go Green campaign, and the North Face sends unwanted clothing and footwear to the nonprofit Soles4Souls. (Both retailers accept items from any brand, in any condition, and provide a store credit in return.) High-quality, in-season clothes can be sold at places like Beacons Closet in New York City, or at Buffalo Exchange locations nationwide. Online resale platforms like TheRealReal consign luxury goods, and ThredUp consigns everything else. Poshmark and Depop allow sellers to list and ship items directly to buyers. Even after a closet is edited and organized, getting dressed again will require practice. When were not used to it  when were putting on sweatpants or staying in our pajamas or just wearing the same kind of thing every day  were out of practice, said Ms. Bornstein, whose clients include the actress Katie Holmes. It is really daunting. Her advice is to dedicate time to trying on clothes and experimenting with outfits. Take photos of your favorite combinations, put them in a folder on your phone, and refer to them like a catalog when you need inspiration or need to get ready in a hurry. This process requires a great deal of self-awareness. Ms. Boyd believes that a wardrobe should always feel relevant  that your closet, at every point in your life, should represent you in that time. As one of Ms. Loves hypothetical questions goes: If you had to buy that piece of clothing today, at full-price, would you honestly buy it? Its not just about decluttering and creating systems Ms. Thompson said. Its a matter of really being honest about the kinds of things you want to do with your life, and then making sure that you have clothing that supports those things. This doesnt have to be an existential crisis. It can be as simple as roller skates. If a client tells me they want to go roller skating, I know theyll need to have their skates at the front of the closet, as opposed to way in the back of the closet, where they have been, she said. An organized closet represents who you are and who you want to be. It represents your truth."

            "content": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa can break through Pfizer/BioNTechs COVID-19 vaccine to some extent, a real-world data study in Israel found, though its prevalence in the country is low and the research has not been peer reviewed. The study, released on Saturday, compared almost 400 people who had tested positive for COVID-19, 14 days or more after they received one or two doses of the vaccine, against the same number of unvaccinated patients with the disease. It matched age and gender, among other characteristics. The South African variant, B.1.351, was found to make up about 1% of all the COVID-19 cases across all the people studied, according to the study by Tel Aviv University and Israels largest healthcare provider, Clalit. But among patients who had received two doses of the vaccine, the variants prevalence rate was eight times higher than those unvaccinated - 5.4% versus 0.7%. This suggests the vaccine is less effective against the South African variant, compared with the original coronavirus and a variant first identified in Britain that has come to comprise nearly all COVID-19 cases in Israel, the researchers said. We found a disproportionately higher rate of the South African variant among people vaccinated with a second dose, compared to the unvaccinated group. This means that the South African variant is able, to some extent, to break through the vaccines protection, said Tel Aviv Universitys Adi Stern. The researchers cautioned, though, that the study only had a small sample size of people infected with the South African variant because of its rarity in Israel. They also said the research was not intended to deduce overall vaccine effectiveness against any variant, since it only looked at people who had already tested positive for COVID-19, not at overall infection rates. Pfizer and BioNTech could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours. The companies said on April 1 that their vaccine was around 91% effective at preventing COVID-19, citing updated trial data that included participants inoculated for up to six months. In respect to the South African variant, they said that among a group of 800 study volunteers in South Africa, where B.1.351 is widespread, there were nine cases of COVID-19, all of which occurred among participants who got the placebo. Of those nine cases, six were among individuals infected with the South African variant. Some previous studies have indicated that the Pfizer/BioNTech shot was less potent against the B.1.351 variant than against other variants of the coronavirus, but still offered a robust defence. While the results of the study may cause concern, the low prevalence of the South African strain was encouraging, according to Stern. Even if the South African variant does break through the vaccines protection, it has not spread widely through the population, said Stern, adding that the British variant may be blocking the spread of the South African strain. Almost 53% of Israels 9.3 million population has received both Pfizer doses. Israel has largely reopened its economy in recent weeks while the pandemic appears to be receding, with infection rates, severe illness and hospitalizations dropping sharply. About a third of Israelis are below the age of 16, which means they are still not eligible for the shot."

            "content": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt and Sudan on Saturday rejected an Ethiopian proposal to share data on the operations of its giant hydropower dam on the Blue Nile after negotiations between the three countries in Kinshasa this week ended without progress. Ethiopia is pinning its hopes of economic development and power generation on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Egypt fears will imperil its supply from the Nile. Sudan is also concerned about the impact on its own water flows. Ethiopia invites Sudan and Egypt to nominate dam operators for data exchange before the filling of GERD in upcoming rainy seasons, the Ethiopian foreign ministry wrote in a tweet on Saturday. But Cairo and Khartoum maintained that they are seeking a legally binding agreement over the operations of the dam, which Addis Ababa says is crucial to its economic development. Sudan believes that exchanging information is a necessary procedure, but that the Ethiopian offer to do so in the manner indicated by their letter implies suspicious selectivity in dealing with what has been agreed upon, the Sudanese irrigation ministry said on Saturday. After the Kinshasa meeting, Ethiopia emphasized that the second-year filling of the dam reservoir would be carried out as scheduled. Sudan will hold 600 million cubic meters (785 million cubic yards) of water at its Jebel Awliya reservoir to ensure the continued operation of the pump stations on the White Nile and the Nile river to meet agricultural and drinking water needs in preparation for Ethiopias second fill, Sudans state news agency SUNA reported on Saturday. The Egyptian irrigation minister on Saturday told a local television talk show that while reserves at the Aswan High Dam could help stave off the effects of a second fill, his chief concern was drought management. Sudan and Egypt had proposed including the European Union, the United States and the United Nations as mediators in addition to ongoing African Union facilitation of the talks. Both countries said Ethiopia rejected the proposal during the Kinshasa meeting. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

            "content": "(Reuters) - Venezuela has paid $64 million, half of the required amount, for doses it is set to receive through the global COVAX program, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez announced Saturday on state television. You know that the COVAX mechanism requires an advance - Venezuela has even doubled the required advance, said Rodriguez, adding that the government had deposited 59.2 million Swiss francs in the accounts of GAVI, a co-leader of the COVAX program that seeks to improve low-income countries access to vaccines. Rodriguez did not specify what funds the government used to pay for the vaccines. In recent months the government has held talks with opposition leaders to obtain vaccines via the COVAX program using funds frozen in the United States. Those efforts had been complicated by President Nicolas Maduros refusal to accept the AstraZeneca vaccine following reports of blood clotting elsewhere. COVAX this year said it had set aside doses of the AstraZeneca shot for use in Venezuela. In her announcement, Rodriguez said Venezuelan health authorities were evaluating which vaccines the country would accept, especially considering various variants of the coronavirus, particularly the variant that originated in Brazil. The vice president highlighted that in September 2020 the government entered into the agreement for over 11 million doses, which would vaccinate around 20% of the population. Rodriguez added that the remaining $60 million worth were guaranteed. COVAX expects to deliver at least 2 billion doses this year and to diversify the offering beyond the AstraZeneca/Oxford and Pfizer/BioNTech shots it is currently supplying. Venezuelas vaccination campaign is behind most other countries in the region. It has received about 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine from China and about 250,000 of Russias Sputnik V, of which authorities recently said they expect the arrival of another 30,000 shortly. Maduro has extended coronavirus lockdown measures several times as the country continues to register high rates of infections. As of Friday, Venezuelan authorities had registered 172,461 coronavirus cases and 1,739 deaths. Medical unions say the number of cases and deaths are likely much higher.

            "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump vowed to help Republicans win seats in Congress in 2022 elections but lashed out at two top party figures, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and former Vice President Mike Pence, at a donor retreat on Saturday. At a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago Club for Republican National Committee donors in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump made clear he is still irked at his inability to hang on to the White House despite losing the Nov. 3 election to Democrat Joe Biden, who is now president. McConnell drew Trumps ire in the aftermath of the election for stating the obvious - that Biden had won the presidency - and the two remain at odds. Parting from the prepared text of his speech, Trump called the senator a son of a bitch, an attendee told Reuters. Before leaving office, Trump had scolded Pence for not intervening to stop the congressional certification of the vote tally, an authority the vice president did not have. The vote certification was the backdrop for the events on Jan. 6 when pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol. Departing again from his prepared text, Trump said he had spoken to Pence recently and told him he was still disappointed in him, the attendee said. Representatives for McConnell and Pence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In prepared remarks seen by Reuters, Trump sought to position himself as the Republican kingmaker, saying he wanted to talk about the future of the Republican Party - and what we must do to set our candidates on a course to victory. I stand before you this evening filled with confidence that in 2022, we are going to take back the House (of Representatives) and we are going to reclaim the Senate. And then in 2024, a Republican candidate is going to win the White House, he said. Trump has spent the 2-1/2 months since his chaotic exit from the White House considering requests from 2022 candidates for his endorsement and has been giving them his blessing based on whether they support him and his agenda or not. He has said any talk of his own plans - the Constitution gives him the right to seek another four-year term - should wait until after the November 2022 elections. A variety of other Republicans are considering their own potential runs for the partys presidential nomination in 2024, such as Trumps former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. While Biden defeated Trump by millions of votes, the Republican made inroads among traditional Democratic voters such as Hispanics and African Americans. Trump, who also sprinkled his remarks with attacks on Biden, said the key to victories in 2022 is to build on those gains, saying the Republican Party will succeed and grow in the future by embracing its destiny as the champion of working-class Americans. Trumps active role in Republican politics despite losing the 2020 election is unlike other former presidents, who have tended to retreat from the limelight after leaving the White House. Saturdays speech will be welcomed words to the Republican donors visiting Mar-a-Lago to hear directly from President Trump. Palm Beach is the new political power center, and President Trump is the Republican Partys best messenger, said Trump adviser Jason Miller. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

            "content": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (Reuters) - Japans Hideki Matsuyama stormed home in style to put himself in position to become the first Asian golfer to win the Masters as he held a four-shot lead after the rain-interrupted third round at Augusta National on Saturday. Matsuyama, who began the day three shots behind overnight leader Justin Rose, played eight holes after a 78-minute weather delay and went a sizzling six under over that stretch for a seven-under-par 65 that brought him to 11 under. Before the horn blew I didnt hit a very good drive, but after the horn blew for the restart I hit practically every shot exactly how I wanted to, Matsuyama, whose last PGA Tour win came in 2017, said through an interpreter. This will be a new experience for me being a leader going into the final round in a major. I guess all I can do is just relax tonight, prepare well and just do my best tomorrow. Rose (72), seeking his first Green Jacket after a pair of close calls, was in a four-way share of second place with Xander Schauffele (68), Australian Marc Leishman (70) and Masters debutant Will Zalatoris (71). World number 25 Matsuyama stormed through Amen Corner with a pair of birdies and then started to pull away from the field with an eagle at the par-five 15th to grab the outright lead following a magnificent approach. Matsuyama then birdied the next two holes before capping the first bogey-free round of the week with a par to set a target nobody could catch as he became the first player from Japan to lead after any round of the Masters. It also marked Matsuyamas best round in his 10 Masters appearances by one shot. Rose, seeking his first Masters victory after a pair of runner-up finishes, had been in control all week and led by two shots moments after play resumed but was out of sync and unable to take advantage of rain-softened conditions. The 40-year-old Englishman made a birdie-birdie start to build an early three-shot lead but then made consecutive bogeys from the par-three fourth before the inclement weather moved in while he was playing the seventh hole. Rose returned and mixed one birdie with a bogey at the par-three 16th and then made a clutch 17-foot par save at the last hole where he sent his drive into the pine straw right of the fairway before missing the green with his second shot. I didnt play well enough today, simple as that really, said Rose. I think all in all, to have a shot tomorrow, Im delighted. Have that freedom to take a run at it, and of course Id love to kind of stay with it just a little bit better. Corey Conners used an eight iron to make a hole-in-one at the 180-yard, par-three sixth hole that helped put the Canadian in contention heading into the final round where he will start five shots back from Matsuyama. Didnt seem like the wind was helping as much as I had anticipated, but fortunately, it flew far enough, said Conners, whose ball took a few bounces before disappearing in the cup. I think I hit the pin with a little bit of steam, but it was right in the middle. So pretty special moment. Former champion Jordan Spieth (72), who came into the week among the favourites after snapping a nearly four-year victory drought, was six shots back after a round that included four birdies, two bogeys and an double-bogey. Schauffele, who drained a 61-foot eagle putt at the par-five 15th that gave him a brief share of the lead until playing competitor Matsuyama made his eagle, will be in the final group for Sundays final round. My dinner will taste a little better, Schauffele said after making some key putts down the stretch and an up-and-down for par at the penultimate hole. It wasnt quite as nice as Hidekis cleanup there on the last few holes, but Ill take it. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Crenshaw, 37, a former Navy lieutenant commander who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, said the retina in his left eye appeared to be detatching as a result of extensive damage suffered in a 2012 attack in Afghanistans Helmand Province. Anyone who knows the history of my injuries knows that I dont have a good eye, but half a good eye, Crenshaw said in the statement. he added. I have gotten through worse before, and I will get through this. Crenshaw, who wears an eyepatch, made national headlines in 2018 when comedian Pete Davidson mocked his appearance on Saturday Night Live. The joke was widely criticized. But Crenshaw appeared on the show alongside Davidson a week later to accept his apology. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The figure was far above the daily averages reported by the health ministry in recent weeks. Mexicos health ministry said two-thirds of the 2,192 deaths reported on Saturday occurred in 2020 and at the time were not marked down as coronavirus fatalities. They were subsequently reviewed by experts. They went through an adjudication process and can now be conferred as deaths by COVID, Gabriela del Carmen Nucamendi Cervantes, director of epidemiological surveillance of non-communicable diseases at the health ministry, said during a news conference. The updated figures took Mexicos total coronavirus death tally to 209,212, the fourth-highest in the world after the United States, Brazil and Russia. The Mexican government previously has said the real case numbers are likely significantly higher, and separate data published recently by the health ministry suggested the actual death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure.

Trevor Rogers allowed three hits and two walks while striking out 10 over six innings in earning his second career win -- both against the Mets in games in which he opposed deGrom at Citi Field -- for the Marlins, who snapped a four-game losing streak. Dylan Floro and Richard Bleier tossed a perfect inning apiece before Yimi Garcia threw a perfect ninth for his first save this season. Jesus Aguilar and Miguel Rojas each had RBI singles in the ninth for the Marlins. The Mets have scored just five runs in losing two of their last three. deGrom (0-1) allowed just the one run on five hits and no walks while striking out 14 batters for the fourth time. The run actually raised his ERA to 0.64. He tossed six scoreless innings Monday before the Mets bullpen squandered a two-run lead in a 5-3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. The right-handed pitcher threw 17 of his first 19 pitches for strikes before Chisholm hit a 100-mph fastball into the second deck in right field for his third career homer. The Marlins got only three runners as far as second base thereafter, but the Mets mounted just one threat over the final eight innings -- one involving deGrom, who led off the sixth with an infield single and went to second when Brandon Nimmo walked. deGrom, who played shortstop in college, tagged up and took third on a deep flyout to center by Francisco Lindor. But Rogers ended his afternoon by striking out Michael Conforto and Pete Alonso. It was the second time Rogers escaped a jam against the heart of the Mets order. New York had its best scoring chance in the first, when Nimmo hit a leadoff double and went to third when catcher Chad Wallach misplayed Lindors bunt. But Lindor was caught stealing and Rogers struck out Conforto and Alonso."

            "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves thought Zach LaVine would develop into a star when they selected him with the 13th pick in the 2014 NBA Draft. The Timberwolves were correct in that assessment, but LaVines stardom has been for Chicago, and it will be on display again when the Bulls visit Minnesota on Sunday night. LaVine is fresh off a career-best 50 points in Fridays 120-108 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. The All-Star guard had 39 points in the first half and scored in an effortless manner that stunned recent Chicago acquisition Nikola Vucevic. I dont think Ive ever been a part of something like that. It looked so easy, Vucevic said. He wasnt forcing -- it just came so naturally to him. And it was so efficient. It was beautiful to see. Everything he does just looks so effortless. Even the way he runs, the way he moves, the way he jumps. Hes so athletic and yet so skilled. I wish that we couldve done better and helped win the game and make this night even more special for him. LaVine made 18-of-31 shots from the field, including 7-of-12 from 3-point range and 7-of-8 from the free-throw line. He also contributed eight rebounds and five assists. Despite his superb effort, the Bulls lost for the ninth time in the past 13 games. That took a little luster off the accomplishment in LaVines eyes. Obviously, Id much rather take the win right now, the 26-year-old LaVine said. I just got in a rhythm. My three finally started falling and after that, I can get to my mid-range, get to the hoop. Just got it going. We have the opportunity to go out there and establish ourselves and make our run. We had a big lead. We gave it up. The seventh-year pro is in his fourth season with the Bulls. He played his first three seasons with the Timberwolves before he was included in the 2017 draft-night trade to acquire Jimmy Butler. Talk about a steal of a deal for the Bulls. Butler quickly wore out his welcome in Minnesota and played in just 69 games over parts of two seasons before being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. Meanwhile, LaVine averaged 23.7 points in his second season in Chicago, raised that average to 25.5 last season, and is up to 27.5 this season. He ranked seventh in the NBA in scoring entering Saturdays play. Minnesota has lost nine of its past 12 games as it begins a four-game homestand. The Timberwolves averaged 136.5 points over their past two contests and still lost both -- 141-137 to the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday and 145-136 in overtime to the Boston Celtics on Friday. Minnesota saw what a 50-point scorer looks like against the Celtics as Jayson Tatum scored a career-best 53 points. The Timberwolves led by 17 points in the third quarter but couldnt slow Tatum. Karl-Anthony Towns had 30 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota while DAngelo Russell scored 26 points and rookie Anthony Edwards 24. I thought we fought hard. We gave ourselves some chances, Russell said. At the end of the game, all you can ask for is a chance. Russell is averaging 22.7 points in three games since returning from a knee injury that caused him to miss nearly two months. The Timberwolves will be watching how he meshes with Edwards, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2020 draft. Edwards, who averages 17.9 points a game, has found his stride and has topped 20 points in seven of the past eight games. The Bulls won this seasons first meeting, 133-126 in overtime at home on Feb. 24. LaVine scored 35 points for the Bulls while Malik Beasley scored 25 to lead the Timberwolves. Beasley is sidelined with a hamstring injury. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Fridays vote pitted only one challenger against the incumbent - relative newcomer Zakaria Ismail Farah. The Interior Ministry data showed that he came second with 2.48% of the 177,391 votes cast. Some 5,447 ballots were declared invalid. Farah said the results were far from reality. This outcome is undoubtedly the result of ballot-box stuffing, (which) occurred in the absence of my delegates, he told Reuters, adding they were barred from accessing polling stations to monitor the process. Alexis Mohamed, the presidents chief advisor, denied the allegations of fraud and said Farah had abstained from casting his vote. Allegations of ballot-box stuffing are absolutely false, the gentleman who raises them didnt even vote and in doing so attacked our democracy, Mohamed told Reuters over the phone. Farah told Reuters in a text message he abstained from voting as he had been victimized from the beginning of his campaign until election day. The Horn of Africa country, with a population of less than 1 million, is relatively stable, especially compared with its regional neighbours Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea. It hosts U.S., Chinese, and French military bases and is located along one of the worlds busiest trade routes, the Gulf of Aden, making it a strategic post. Ethiopia and Somalias leaders congratulated Guelleh on his victory. One of Africas longest-ruling leaders, Guelleh, 73, has been in power since 1999 when he was handpicked by his uncle Hassan Gouled Aptidon, the countrys first president after it gained independence from France in 1977. He won the last two elections, in 2016 and 2011, decisively. Some opposition parties boycotted those votes too. In 2010 his government amended the constitution on presidential term limits allowing him to run for office more than twice, though an age limit of 75 was inserted, meaning that this is supposed to be his last term. Last year, security forces suppressed rare anti-government street protests which erupted after the arrest of a former air force pilot who had denounced corruption and clan-based discrimination.

            "content": "TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyas new unity government launched a long-delayed COVID-19 vaccination programme on Saturday after receiving some 160,000 vaccine doses over the past week, with the prime minister receiving his jab on live television. While Libya is richer than its neighbours due to oil exports, the countrys healthcare system has been strained by years of political turmoil and violence, and it has struggled to cope during the pandemic. Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibeh called it a blessed day in the fight against COVID-19 after receiving his shot, without saying which vaccine he had been given. At least 100,000 of the doses that arrived this week were Russias Sputnik V vaccine. Dbeibehs interim Government of National Unity was sworn in last month after emerging through a U.N.-facilitated process with a mandate to unify the country, improve state services and oversee the run-up to a national election in December. Dbeibehs government has framed the delivery of vaccines and the national roll-out as evidence that it is improving the lives of ordinary Libyans after replacing two warring administrations that ruled in the east and west of the country. Through the political consultations and the efforts of the prime minister, the vaccine is available, said Health Minister Ali al-Zanati, who has said previously the government had so far ordered enough doses to inoculate 1.4 million of the countrys more than six million people. Libyas National Centre for Disease Control has said more than 400,000 people have registered for vaccination in more than 400 centres around the country. Libya has recorded more than 166,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 3,000 deaths, though U.N. envoys have said the true figures are likely far higher. I feel sorry that the vaccine arrived late in Libya after thousands were infected. But better late than never, said Ali al-Hadi, a shop owner, adding that his wife had been sick with COVID-19 and recovered. Many Libyans fear the vaccination campaign could be marred by political infighting or favouritism after years of unrest. We hope the Health Ministry will steer away from political conflicts so that services can reach patients, said housewife Khawla Muhammad, 33. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Although Frances top health authority advised a six-week period between the two shots in January in order to stretch supplies, the government at the time said there was insufficient data on how well the vaccines performed with a longer interval. France could safely do so now because it was vaccinating a younger age group, Veran said. (It) will allow us to vaccinate more quickly without reducing protection, the minister told the paper. France has approved use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines. Veran also said that from Monday the AstraZeneca vaccine would be made available to all over-55s and not just those with serious pre-existing conditions. After a glacial start, Frances vaccine rollout is hitting its stride, reaching a target of 10 million first doses a week ahead of a mid-April target. The government aims to deliver another ten million first shots by mid-May. Johnson & Johnson would deliver its first 200,000 doses destined for France on Monday, a week early, Veran said. President Emmanuel Macron, who was forced by a spiralling infection rate and overloaded healthcare system to impose a third nationwide lockdown, is counting on an accelerated vaccine rollout to allow a gradual reopening of the country from the middle of next month. The numbers in intensive care continue to rise and France will almost certainly cross the 100,000 deaths threshold this week. It reported over 43,000 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday and said there were now 5,769 patients receiving critical care. However, Veran said there were signs that a new lockdown was beginning to slow the infection rate. It remains very high, Veran told the JDD. We can expect that after a period of stabilisation comes the fall. But for that, we must keep going. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Following are details about the funeral. The funeral will take place at St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle at 1500 local time on April 17. It will be whats known as a ceremonial royal funeral, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. The plans for the funeral are very much in line with the Duke of Edinburghs own personal wishes. There will be no public access, no public processions and the funeral will take place entirely within the grounds of Windsor Castle. The queen has approved the plans. Philip currently lies at rest in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle. There will be no lying in state.

The congregation will adhere to national COVID guidelines. At the end of the service Philip will be interred in the Royal Vault in St Georges Chapel. The funeral will be broadcast live. There will be a period of national mourning until the end of Saturday April 17. The royal family will observe two weeks of royal mourning. While this is naturally a time of sadness and mourning for the Royal Family and the many others who knew or admired The Duke of Edinburgh, it is hoped that the coming days will also be seen as an opportunity to celebrate a remarkable life, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. Philip was remarkable both in terms of his vast contribution and lasting legacy. Prince Charles and other members of the royal family will take part in the procession on foot behind Philips coffin. The queen will not walk in the procession. Prince Harry plans to attend the funeral though his pregnant wife Meghan has been advised not to by her physician. The Duke of Sussex is planning to attend, the Buckingham Palace spokesman said. The Duchess of Sussex has been advised by her physician not to travel. The guest list for the funeral will be limited to 30 in line with government guidelines, meaning attendees will wear masks. Philips coffin currently rests, covered with his personal standard and a wreath of flowers in the Private Chapel. On the day of the funeral, the coffin, covered by his standard a wreath, his naval cap and sword and accompanied by the Dean of Windsor and the Lord Chamberlain, will be moved to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle by a bearer party from the Queens Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. In the quadrangle at Windsor Castle, representative detachments drawn from Philips special military relationships such as the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, The Grenadier Guards, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, the Intelligence Corps and the Highlanders will line up. The Foot Guards and the Household Cavalry will line up around the perimeter of the quadrangle. The coffin will leave the State Entrance of Windsor Castle at 1445 local time in a specially modified Land Rover which Prince Philip helped to design. The band of the Grenadier Guards, of which The Duke of Edinburgh was colonel for 42 years, will lead the procession. The Land Rover will be flanked by pall bearers from the Royal Marines, Regiments, Corps and Air Stations. The coffin will arrive at the foot of the West Steps of St Georges Chapel at 1453 to a Guard of Honour and Band from The Rifles. Positioned in the Horseshoe Cloister will be the Commonwealth Defence Advisers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago. The West Steps of St Georges Chapel will be lined by a dismounted detachment of the Household Cavalry. A Royal Naval Piping Party will pipe the Still once the Land Rover is stationery at the foot of the West Steps. The coffin will pause for the national minute of silence at 1500 local time. The Duke of Edinburghs insignia - essentially the medals and decorations conferred on Philip, his Field Marshals baton and Royal Air Force Wings, together with insignia from Denmark and Greece, will be positioned on cushions on the altar in St Georges Chapel.

Biologists with the non-profit Marine Mammal Center in California said in a release Saturday that two dead whales washed ashore in the Bay area on Thursday, joining two more that were discovered dead in area beaches since March 31. Of the four animals, two died from blunt force trauma from ship strikes, the center said. Its alarming to respond to four dead gray whales in just over a week because it really puts into perspective the current challenges faced by this species, Padraig Duignan, director of pathology at the center said in a news release. Other common causes of gray whale deaths include starvation and complications from becoming entangled in deep sea fishing lines nets and other equipment, the center said. The centers experts were joined by biologists from the California Academy of Sciences to perform the necropsies. Climate change can affect water temperatures which impacts on the availability of food for the whales, which can grow to nearly 50 feet long and migrate about 10,000 miles every year between feeding grounds in the cold, north Pacific waters and breeding grounds in warm-water lagoons of Mexicos Baja California Peninsula. The species is not currently considered endangered but is protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries division tracks whale populations. Its last published study in 2016 found a population of 27,000 gray whales. Data from a 2020 study is still being analyzed, according to the NOAA website. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

            "content": "LONDON (Reuters) -Chelsea roared back into fourth spot in the Premier League as Christian Pulisic scored twice in an impressive 4-1 victory at London rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday. After boss Thomas Tuchels long unbeaten run since taking charge ended abruptly against West Bromwich Albion last week, Chelsea responded in emphatic fashion. Kai Havertz punished some sloppy defending to give Chelsea an eighth-minute lead and Pulisic doubled their advantage two minutes later with a powerful finish. Chelsea totally dominated the first half and went 3-0 up on the half hour with a Kurt Zouma header. Palace did improve after the break and Christian Bentekes header gave them a lifeline but Pulisic made the points safe with a close-range finish after 78 minutes. Chelsea had started the game in sixth place after Liverpools last-gasp win against Aston Villa. But Chelseas biggest margin of victory since Tuchel took charge in January moved them back above Liverpool and West Ham United into fourth place with 54 points from 31 games, two ahead of West Ham, who host third-placed Leicester City on Sunday. Palace stay in 13th spot. The first half an hour was excellent. We were very hungry, very aggressive and got a lot of recoveries in the final third, Tuchel said. After 35 minutes we dropped a little in position and got a little bit sloppy. We continued like this a little in the second half but it was a good reaction after their goal. We put pressure on ourselves to have the right response. It was a step in the right direction. Chelseas opener came after Palace winger Eberechi Eze was caught in possession by Mason Mount on the edge of the area. He then fed Callum Hudson-Odoi who in turn played in Havertz to coolly place his shot beyond keeper Vicente Guaita. Their second was all about their slick passing as Palace were left chasing shadows. The ball was eventually cut back by Havertz for Pulisic to take a touch and smash a shot high into the net. Chelsea were in cruise control after half an hour when Mount curled in a free kick and Zouma rose to head home. Bentekes header snapped Chelsea back into full throttle and Pulisic rounded off a great display when he slid in to convert substitute Reece Jamess low cross.

            "content": "BISHKEK (Reuters) - Voters in Kyrgyzstan are likely to support handing greater powers to the presidency in a referendum on Sunday, given high public trust in President Sadyr Japarov, a populist politician catapulted into the post from a prison cell last year. The constitutional reform will make the political system of the Central Asian nation similar to that of its ex-Soviet neighbours such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, making it easier for Japarov to push through his policies. Japarov and his supporters also hope the strengthening of the presidency will make the country more stable after its leaders were toppled by violent revolts in 2005, 2010 and 2020. Kyrgyzstan borders China and is closely allied with Russia. A poll ordered by the United States-based International Republican Institute and published this month showed that Japarov was by far the most trusted politician in the country and had solid political capital. The percentage of voters who believed Kyrgyzstan was headed in the right direction jumped from 41% last August - when Japarovs predecessor Sooronbai Jeenbekov was in charge - to 70% in February and March, poll data showed. Preliminary results of the vote are expected to be announced late on Sunday. Japarov proposed the reform after coming to power amid violent protests last October triggered by the announcement of pro-Jeenbekov parties landslide victory a parliamentary election. A former member of parliament and senior official, Japarov had been previously serving a prison term for his role in the kidnapping of a regional governor as part of a political protest. His sentence has since been overturned. Unlike its neighbours, when Kyrgyzstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 it adopted a political system where both parliament and the presidency wielded significant powers, forcing its leaders to seek the backing of broader elites.

            "content": "NEW YORK -Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who helped shape U.S. civil rights law during the Johnson administration but went on to travel the globe to fight human rights abuses by his own country as he saw them, has died at age 93. Clark, one of the architects of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Act of 1968, died on Friday, family member Sharon Welch said, according to media outlets including the New York Times and the Washington Post. In a lengthy career of representing unpopular causes, Clark defended or gave advice to Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Liberian political figure Charles Taylor and Iraqs Saddam Hussein. Domestically he was active for conservative politician Lyndon LaRouche, Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and antiwar activist the Reverend Philip Berrigan. In the 1990s, he helped found the leftist International Action Center in New York, which drew attention in 1999 for street protests condemning the U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. In an interview with Reuters in July 2001 as he was preparing to give Milosevic legal advice on charges filed by a U.N. international war crimes tribunal, Clark discussed his commitment to human rights. For 30 years Ive supported the idea and worked for the creation of an international criminal court that has universal jurisdiction and is independent of all political influence and that has the power to prosecute the high and the mighty as well as the weak and the defeated, Clark said. Equality is the mother of justice. If there is no equality in law, there is no justice. Cubas president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, lamented Clarks death on Twitter on Saturday. He was an honest and supportive man that stood by our side during crucial battles and denounced the great injustices committed by his country worldwide, Diaz-Canel wrote. #Cuba pays him grateful tribute. Hanan Ashrawi, a former member of the Palestine Liberation Organizations Executive Committee, wrote on Twitter that Clark was an indefatigable defender of Palestinian & human rights, a lawyer who knew & pursued genuine justice & the rights of the oppressed. The United Nations recognized Clarks work in 2008 by naming him one of the winners of its prestigious prize in the field of human rights. Others who have received the prize include former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and South African leader Nelson Mandela. Clark was born in Dallas into a prominent Texas family on Dec. 18, 1927. His father, Tom Clark, was named U.S. attorney general by President Harry Truman in 1945 and then to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1949. Ramsey Clark served in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, making the rank of corporal, attended the University of Texas and the University of Chicago and then practiced law in Dallas. He joined the Justice Department under Democratic President John Kennedy in 1961 and served in top posts until Democratic President Lyndon Johnson nominated him as attorney general in 1967. His father retired from the Supreme Court to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. In the years after government service, Clark raised eyebrows many times by befriending some of the declared enemies of the United States, including Gaddafi, Saddam and Milosevic. Clark, in response to a 1986 U.S. military attack on Libya which Washington had accused of terrorism, visited the North African country. At the outbreak of the 1991 Gulf War, Clark defied the U.S.-led coalition to visit Saddam in Baghdad. He returned to Iraq several times over the years to condemn U.N. sanctions that were depriving Iraqi children of food and medicine. He joined Saddams defense team when the former Iraqi president went on trial for war crimes and even lectured the judge on how to conduct a fair trial. In the Milosevic case and in the case of a Rwandan militiaman he represented on war crimes charges, Clark argued that the international tribunals established by the United Nations were illegal because there was no provision for them in the U.N. Charter. As a top Justice Department official, Clark engaged himself in civil rights. Among his many tasks were surveying Southern school districts desegregating under court order in 1963 and supervising the federal presence at the University of Mississippi following the admission of James Meredith as the schools first black student. Clark also helped draft and direct passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 containing the first federal open housing law. In an ironic twist considering his later activist role, Clark as attorney general oversaw the prosecution during the Vietnam War of an antiwar group known as the Boston Five for helping draft resisters. Four of the five, including famed pediatrician Benjamin Spock and Yale chaplain William Sloane Coffin, were convicted. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Despite playing two more games than Boston, the Flyers pulled within four points of the final playoff spot in the East following a 3-2 win over the Bruins on Saturday afternoon. They will move even closer if they can come up with two more points against the Sabres. We know, Flyers defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere said on NBC Sports Philadelphia, when asked if his team is keeping tabs on the standings. Weve got to take it game by game. Weve got to get points. The Flyers lost a prime opportunity to do just that on March 31 when they were defeated 6-1 by the Sabres, who had lost their previous 18 games (0-15-3). While this may look like an easy win for Philadelphia, thats clearly not the case. I think every game weve played the last couple of weeks has been a war, Gostisbehere said on NBC Sports Philadelphia. Travis Konecny collected one goal and one assist on Saturday while Gostisbehere and Sean Couturier also tallied. That was a big two points, Flyers head coach Alain Vigneault said. Weve got to get ready for (Sunday). Its our fifth game in seven days. Weve got to be on top of our game. The Flyers picked up two huge points, largely because they killed off all four Bruins power plays. It took a lot of energy, but was necessary to stay afloat. Our PK guys did a great job, Vigneault said. Buffalo will be hoping to avoid a third straight loss when it opens a three-game road trip on Sunday. There havent been many positive moments for the skidding Sabres, who will miss the playoffs for the 10th straight season. Some of the Sabres younger players have been developing nicely -- including 22-year-old Casey Mittelstadt, who has four goals in his last six games. Thats a priority and it will remain a priority simply because their ceiling is so high and we need to become a better team, Buffalo interim head coach Don Granato said. Evaluating players like Mittelstadt will be crucial for the Sabres, who are expected to be active prior to Mondays trade deadline. I just had some time to grow up, said Mittelstadt, who was selected eighth overall in the 2017 NHL Draft. I think thats (it) more than anything. I dont know, its so much on the ice, off the ice getting myself ready to play, taking care of my body away from the rink. I think you get in what you put out. Tage Thompson has also scored three times in the last five games. With Tage, hes at a point now where he can be pushed, pushed hard, Granato said. And weve pushed him and hes responding.

            "content": "The Dallas Mavericks will look to continue their climb up the Western Conference standings and take advantage of a rare break from the rigors of the COVID-influenced NBA schedule when they host the reeling San Antonio Spurs on Sunday evening. The Mavericks have won six of their past seven games to move into the seventh spot in the West. Dallas most recent game was a 116-101 home win over short-handed Milwaukee on Thursday that came a night after the Mavs lost at Houston. It was a very competitive game, a combative game -- a lot of emotional things going on out there, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. But the No. 1 overall positive in the game was how we held our poise. Were proud as a team. Great bounce back after the disappointment of (Wednesday) night. On Sunday, Dallas will look for the first season sweep of the Spurs in the 41-year history of the Mavericks franchise. The Mavs beat San Antonio on the road by five points in January and by 11 in Dallas last month. Luka Doncic scored 27 points to lead the Mavericks past Milwaukee on Thursday, but it was Kristaps Porzingis who had the games most important stretch. Porzingis, playing on consecutive days for the first time since January, scored 11 points in the fourth quarter Thursday when Dallas clinched the game. He finished with 26 points and 17 rebounds. Josh Richardson scored 14 points, and Maxi Kleber and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 12 each for the Mavericks in the win. There has been some question about the on-court chemistry between Doncic and Porzingis, the Mavericks two bona fide stars, but winning the way Dallas has lately has doubters backing off some. Yeah, were trying to play together and help each other, Porzingis said after the victory Thursday. We want to win. At the end, we all want to win the game. We have to keep playing and keep playing together and keep playing well and help each other. The Spurs head to Dallas on the heels of a 121-119 loss to Denver on Friday in the second game of a two-game series between the teams in the Mile High City. San Antonio never led in the game but had three chances to tie in the final 5.1 seconds after mounting a rousing fourth-quarter comeback. Instead, the Spurs suffered their fifth straight loss, a season high for consecutive defeats and their longest since they dropped five in a row from Feb. 3-10, 2020. San Antonio has lost 10 of its past 12 games and is free-falling in the Western Conference standings. We kept fighting -- we kept competing, San Antonio guard Derrick White said. Thats kind of been our mantra all year, just keep getting back into it. We upped our physicality a little bit, started getting going a little bit. Cant keep digging ourselves into those holes, but it was nice to fight back. All five starters scored in double figures for the Spurs on Fridays loss. White led the way with 25 points, DeMar DeRozan added 24 points and 12 assists, Keldon Johnson and Rudy Gay scored 15 each, Jakob Poeltl recorded 13 points and 10 rebounds, and Dejounte Murray hit for 12 points. DeRozan said the Spurs understand they are going to have to take the lead in getting over the hump and back on the winning track. We are not putting a Batman sign up in the sky, waiting on Bruce Wayne to come, DeRozan said. We are definitely going to figure it out. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Montas (1-1) pitched the Athletics to their first series victory this season, limiting the Astros to one run on six hits and one walk with five strikeouts over six-plus innings while improving to 5-3 in 10 career appearances against Houston. He allowed the lone run on his 100th pitch, a 3-2 slider that Astros right fielder Kyle Tucker drilled into the right-field seats leading off the seventh. With Oakland leading 2-0 in the top of the fifth, Laureano blasted his first home run this season 415 feet to left off Astros starter Jose Urquidy (0-1), driving home Mark Canha and doubling the lead. Canha reached on a two-out single just prior to Laureano jumping on a first-pitch slider. Lowrie added a two-run, two-out single off Astros reliever Brandon Bielak for a 6-0 lead in the seventh before Brown cranked a solo homer against Ryne Stanek, the third Houston pitcher of the game, with two outs in the eighth. Browns first home run of the season helped stymie the momentum the Astros had generated in the seventh when Jose Altuve and Michael Brantley followed the Tucker home run with run-scoring extra-base hits. Altuve drove in Myles Straw with his second double of the afternoon and in the process notched his 463rd multi-hit game, a total that moved him past Cesar Cedeno and into fourth place in club history. Brantley plated Altuve with a triple to right-center that cut the Oakland lead in half at 6-3. Canha, Laureano (three hits) and Lowrie recorded multi-hit games atop the Athletics batting order and finished a combined 7-for-14 with five runs scored, four RBIs plus a walk.

            "content": "LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Trent Alexander-Arnold scored a stunning stoppage-time winner as Liverpool fought back to snatch a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa and move provisionally into the Premier Leagues top four on Saturday. Juergen Klopps side collected their first home league win in 2021 after right back Alexander-Arnold scored with a curling effort from the edge of the box at the death. The win moved Liverpool up to fourth, on 52 points, above West ham United on goal difference, yet their stay in the top four will be short-lived if Chelsea beat Crystal Palace in the final game of the day. Having suffered a humiliating 7-2 defeat at Villa Park in October, defending champions Liverpool enjoyed a better start at Anfield as Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota tested visiting goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez with early attempts. But Villa, against the run of play, found the breakthrough in the 43rd minute when John McGinn slotted a neat pass into striker Ollie Watkins, whose drilled effort slipped under Liverpool keeper Alissons right arm. Liverpool responded almost immediately through Roberto Firmino but his goal was chalked off by VAR as Jota was adjudged to be marginally offside in the buildup. Yet the hosts deservedly equalised 12 minutes into the second half through a Salah header after left back Andy Robertsons initial strike was palmed away by Martinez. It was Liverpools first goal in open play at Anfield since Dec. 27 - a run of run of 12 hours and 44 minutes since Sadio Mane found the net against West Bromwich Albion. They netted one home goal from the penalty spot during that time. Klopps side stepped up the intensity and Alexander-Arnolds sublime effort secured all three points. We have lost a couple of games here and mentally it was like oh no, not again but we did a good job second half, Salah told Sky Sports. Its really important to win. I think there are only seven games left? We want to play Champions League next year but we just need to focus on each game and try and win them all and hopefully, we can be in that fourth place. Villa boss Dean Smith, who was once again without the injured playmaker Jack Grealish, conceded his players struggled to create enough goalscoring opportunities in the second half as they remain 10th in the table. We had some good opportunities but didnt have that final pass, Smith said. Weve come to Liverpool, knew how they would play and how determined they were to put things right at Anfield but its disappointing to concede so late.

Right-hander Logan Webb combined with four relievers on a nine-hitter as the Giants won their third straight overall and second in a row over the Rockies. Ryan McMahon smacked his fifth home run of the season for the Rockies, who lost for the sixth time in their last eight games after an Opening Day win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. After McMahons homer, a two-run shot, had given Colorado a 3-1 lead in the fifth, Alex Dickerson and pinch-hitter Wilmer Flores led off the last of the sixth with consecutive walks off Rockies reliever Ben Bowden (0-2). One out later, Crawford scaled the brick wall in right field for his second homer of the season, a three-run blast that produced the final scoring in the contest. Crawford had been the offensive star of Fridays 3-1 win as well, ending a scoreless tie in the seventh inning with a two-run double. Giants relievers Caleb Baragar (2-0), Reyes Moronta, Tyler Rogers and Jake McGee combined to shut out Colorado on one hit and one walk over the final four innings, with McGee earning his second straight save and fourth of the season. Webb worked the first five innings, allowing eight hits and three runs. He walked two and struck out six. Neither he nor Colorado starter Chi Chi Gonzalez got a decision. Gonzalez also was pulled after five innings, charged with one run on four hits. He walked three and struck out one. The Giants Dickerson and Rockies Raimel Tapia exchanged early RBI singles to account for the 1-1 tie that was broken by McMahons homer in the fifth.

            "content": "Trent Grisham hit a two-run homer off Wes Benjamin in the top of the seventh Saturday night that erased a one-run Texas lead and helped carry the visiting San Diego Padres to a 7-4 win over the Rangers in Arlington, Texas. The Rangers were leading 4-3 on Isiah Kiner-Falefas tie-breaking, solo homer off Padres reliever Ryan Weathers in the bottom of the fifth when Grisham connected on his first homer of the season. Grisham had returned from the injured list Friday night. Ha-Seong Kim, who had tied the game at 3-3 in the top of the fifth with his first major league homer, drew a one-out walk off Benjamin (0-1), who took the loss, in the top of the three-run seventh. After Grisham homered, Josh Sborz entered the game for Texas and gave up a single to Jurickson Profar followed by a run-scoring double by Manny Machado. The Padres, who have won seven straight interleague games from the Rangers, scored their final run in the eighth when Jake Cronenworth scored on a two-out error -- a throw from short going through the webbing of first baseman Nate Lowes glove. Weathers was credited with his first major league victory. Mark Melancon earned his fourth save. Profar and Cronenworth had three hits apiece as the Padres finished with 14 hits and 20 base runners. The Rangers turned four double plays, one coming with the bases loaded to end the third. Neither starting pitcher was sharp. The Rangers took a 3-0 lead against Padres right-hander Chris Paddack with a two-out rally in the second. Jonah Heim doubled into the right-field corner and scored on a triple to left by Eli White. After Anderson Tejeda drew a walk, Kiner-Falefa hit a two-run double. But the Padres went to work against right-hander Jordan Lyles in the fourth. Eric Hosmer led off with a home run. Singles by Wil Myers and Cronenworth put runners at the corners, with Myers scoring on Tommy Phams sacrifice fly to right. Kim, who is filling in for the injured Fernando Tatis Jr., followed with his game-tying homer in the fifth. Kiner-Falefa had three RBIs for the Rangers on the two-run double and go-ahead homer."

            "content": "Austin Meadows and Randy Arozarena each homered as the Tampa Bay Rays continued their dominance over the visiting New York Yankees with a 4-0 victory Saturday afternoon in St. Petersburg, Fla. The Rays beat the Yankees for the 12th time in the past 14 regular-season meetings. They have outscored New York by a 14-5 margin in the first two games of this series. Meadows belted his third homer this season and seventh career against the Yankees just two batters into the game. He gave the Rays a 1-0 lead when he deposited a 2-1 changeup from Domingo German (0-2) off the foul pole in right field. The Yankees after the game optioned German to the teams alternate training site. Arozarena, who had three hits, launched his first homer of the season when he led off the third inning by hitting Germans first-pitch fastball over the wall in center field. Including last seasons five-game American League Division Series, it was his fifth homer in 10 career games against the Yankees. Francisco Mejia sandwiched the homers with a two-run single with one out in the second inning. He gave the Rays a 3-0 lead when German could not field his comebacker and the ball deflected off his glove into right field, allowing Joey Wendle and Willy Adames to score. Not all the news was good for Tampa Bay, however. Chris Archers first start since returning to the Rays was cut short after 2 1/3 innings due to right lateral forearm tightness. He allowed three hits, tossed 42 pitches and departed after allowing a double to DJ LeMahieu. After Archer departed, five pitchers combined for the final 20 outs. Andrew Kittredge (2-0) pitched 1 2/3 innings, Jeffrey Springs tossed two frames while Ryan Thompson and Cody Reed pitched an inning apiece. Chris Mazza finished off Tampa Bays latest win over the Yankees by needing eight pitches in a perfect ninth. New York lost its third straight game, went 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position and struck out nine times. Aaron Judge returned from missing the past two games with soreness in his right side. He was 1-for-4 with a pair of strikeouts. German allowed four runs on eight hits in four innings."

Blues winger Mike Hoffman scored his second goal of the game with 45 seconds left in regulation to force the overtime. Vince Dunn had three assists and Ville Husso made 28 saves for the Blues, who won their third straight game. Matt Dumba and Nico Sturm scored for the Wild and Cam Talbot made 27 saves. After suffering a 9-1 blowout loss Friday night in St. Louis, the Wild responded with a sturdy defensive performance. They outshot the Blues 9-6 in the first period while taking a 1-0 lead. After Blues defenseman Jake Walman turned the puck over while trying to gain the Minnesota zone, Colton Parayko fell down trying to scramble back to cover for him. That gave Sturm, back in the lineup after sitting out Friday, a free skate up the left wing and an open shot from the left dot -- which he buried. Hoffman, who was also a healthy scratch Friday, tied the game with a power-play goal at 3:07 of the second period. His one-time shot from the right circle deflected off Wild defenseman Jonas Brodin and past Talbot. Dumba put the Wild back on top with a power-play goal with 1:42 left in the second period. He scored with a slap shot from the top of the left circle through a well-timed screen. Blues forward Zach Sanford nearly tied the game with 11 1/2 minutes left, but his backhand shot rang off the inside of the right post from point-blank range. With Husso pulled for an extra attacker, the Blues scored a 6-on-5 goal to tie the game 2-2. Hoffman fired a shot from above the right circle that caromed off Talbot, then Dumba, and into the net. OReilly won the game by circling the net and lifting a backhand shot over Talbots shoulder with time winding down in overtime."

Boston has won five consecutive games after being swept by the Orioles in the season-opening series. Meanwhile, the Orioles have lost four of five since that sweep at Fenway. Baltimore trailed 3-2 going into the eighth but tied it, then took the lead when Freddy Galvis singled in Ryan McKenna with one out. Boston got it to 4-4 in the ninth as Marwin Gonzalez scored on a groundout by Bobby Dalbec. Rafael Devers had a big game for the Red Sox as he hit a home run and had a hand in Bostons first three runs. Bruce Zimmermann, a native of the Baltimore area, got his second start of the season for the Orioles. Although he pitched at Camden Yards last season, this was Zimmermanns first start in front of home fans. He had plenty of supporters to see him go six innings, giving up three earned runs off seven hits while striking out four. He got off to a rocky start, giving up two runs in the first. Boston got its first run on a single from Devers that scored Alex Verdugo; Xander Bogaerts raced home as Devers got caught in a rundown for the final out of the inning. Baltimore answered in the bottom of the inning as Trey Mancini and Anthony Santander went back-to-back over the right-centerfield wall. After all that excitement in the first, the score remained tied at 2 up until Devers hit a solo shot to right with two outs in the sixth. Boston starter Garrett Richards settled in after giving up the two home runs in the first, surrendering three hits in five innings of work and striking out four. The Red Sox were without slugger J.D. Martinez, as he was placed on the COVID-19 Related Injured List. They replaced Martinez on the 26-man roster with Chavis, an infielder who was recalled from the alternate training site at Triple-A Worcester. Chavis began the 10th inning as Bostons runner on second and scored the go-ahead run. Martinez was on a tear to start the season, hitting .433 (13-for-30) with seven doubles, two home runs and 12 RBI. Coming into Saturday, he led all players with nine extra-base hits."

Kris Bryant hit an RBI double and Joc Pederson an RBI single for the Cubs, who have lost three of four. Chicago Starter Zach Davies (1-1) allowed seven runs on five hits in a career-low 1 2/3 innings, with three walks and two strikeouts. Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the first. Ian Happ drew a leadoff walk and, two outs later, scored on Bryants double off the wall in the gap in left-center. Pittsburgh sent 12 players to the plate in the bottom of the second. Moran walked to lead off and went to third on Erik Gonzalezs double off Happs glove at the wall in center. Gregory Polanco walked to load the bases. Stallings single to left brought Moran and Gonzalez home to put the Pirates ahead 2-1 and sent Polanco to third. After Anthony Alford struck out, Keller reached on a fielders choice bunt. Frazier followed with a double to right to drive in Polanco and make it 3-1, and Evans walked to load the bases for Reynolds, whose ground-rule double to left scored Keller and Frazier to up it to 5-1. Morans base hit to right drove in Evans and Reynolds to close the scoring that inning and make it 7-1, chasing Davies.

            "content": "The Boston Celtics have won four of their past five games to climb above the .500 mark, but that record will be tested over the next week. Boston heads out on a three-game Western Conference trip to some tough cities. First stop is Denver for a Sunday matinee game against one of the hottest teams in the league before dates in Portland and Los Angeles against the Lakers. The Nuggets have won eight straight and 17 of their past 20, including the past three without second-leading scorer Jamal Murray, who is sidelined with right-knee soreness. Denver has yet to lose in the seven games since acquiring Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee in separate trade deadline deals and can make it a perfect four-game homestand with a win over the Celtics on Sunday. Boston is coming in with some momentum and history. The Celtics rallied at home to beat Minnesota in overtime on Friday night, but the talk of the night was the career-high 53 points by Jayson Tatum. At 23 years and 37 days, Tatum became the youngest Celtic to score 50 or more points in a game. Larry Bird had the distinction until Friday. Bird was 26 years, 113 days old when he eclipsed the mark on March 30, 1983. Tatum enjoyed the moment after Fridays win. It will be a night Ill always remember, he said. My first 50-point game, (and) we got the win on top of that. I just grew up wanting to be in the NBA when I was a kid. Now Im living out my dream at a high level, and its more than I could have ever wished for. The celebration might not last if Boston cant contain Nikola Jokic. The Nuggets center had his 13th triple-double of the season and 54th of his career in Fridays 121-119 win over the San Antonio Spurs. He has put himself into strong contention for the MVP Award this year, especially now that Denver is winning game after game. If coaches had an MVP vote, San Antonios Gregg Popovich would be leaning toward the 7-foot Serbian. Thats why theyre a hell of a team, Popovich said after his teams second loss to the Nuggets in three nights. Jokic is maybe the best passer in the league. (He is) certainly the best big-man passer and better than most wings. So, sure, he sets the table for everybody; hes great. Gordon and Michael Porter Jr. have benefited from Jokics court vision. Porter had 22 points and 10 rebounds in the win, the fifth time in the past seven games he has recorded a double-double. Denvers winning streak has enabled coach Mike Malone to sit Murray. The Nuggets have been thinner in the back court with him out and the team trading guards Gary Harris and RJ Hampton to Orlando in the Gordon deal, so they signed Shaq Harrison to a two-way deal on Friday for depth reasons. If you look at his body of work, the games hes played in the NBA, I think a thing that stands out for me is he is a tremendous defensive player at the guard position, Malone said."

            "content": "(Reuters) - A U.S. Army lieutenant filed a lawsuit against two Virginia police officers in federal court over what court papers say was a violent traffic stop, where officers pointed their guns, knocked him to the ground, pepper sprayed him and threatened to murder him. The suit, filed by Army officer Caron Nazario on April 2 in the U.S. District Court of Norfolk, Virginia, against Windsor policemen Joe Gutierrez and Daniel Crocker, alleges violations to his constitutional rights, and includes assault, illegal search and illegal detention. The incident captured on video comes at a time of heightened awareness over police arrests of minorities and racial justice, in the wake of the ongoing televised trial of former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody last May. Telephone calls to the two police officers named in the suit, the Windsor police department and Nazarios attorney Jonathan Arthur, were not immediately returned to Reuters. Nazario, who is Latino and Black, was in uniform and driving his new SUV with a temporary paper tag displayed on the back window on December 5, when he was told to pull over on U.S. Highway 460 in Windsor, Virginia, a town of about 2,600 residents and about 70 miles southeast of Richmond. When a police cruiser signaled for him to stop, the lawsuit says Nazario put on his blinkers, slowed down and looked for a lighted place to stop. The suit says an officer radioed to dispatch that a driver without a tag was eluding police and it was considered a high risk stop, and another police officer responded to the scene. Nazario stopped at a nearby gas station, less than two minutes after being signaled to pull over. During the stop, which was captured on police body cameras and Nazarios cell phone, Nazario told police that he was afraid to get out of the vehicle. An officer responded, Yeah you should be, the suit says. An officer also stated that Nazario was fixing to ride the lightning, in an apparent reference to execution by electrocution. During the arrest, the suit says Nazario had his hands up, offered no resistance, but was pepper sprayed and violently knocked to the ground and detained. Ultimately the police chief responded to the scene and Nazario was released without charges, the suit says. After the altercation, the suit says that officer Gutierrez said he understood why Nazario looked for a lighted place to pull over, and said: I get it, the media spewing race relations between law enforcement and minorities. I get it. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Dowling skated in and dished a cross-ice feed to LEsperance, who lifted the puck over Bobrovsky for a 2-0 lead. Stunned, the Panthers tried to get physical. But Florida defenseman Radko Gudas was penalized for boarding on Rhett Gardner. The Stars power play then clicked in just 22 seconds. Pavelski, from behind the net, flipped a pass to Benn, who played the puck off his right skate and hammered home a goal from the slot at point-blank range. Florida cut its deficit to 3-1 on Barkovs power-play goal with just 1.5 seconds left in the second. Patric Hornqvist tried to jam the puck in, but it was blocked by defenseman Andrej Sekera. Barkov then scored on his second rebound attempt. Ex-Panthers defenseman Mark Pysyk set up the man advantage by getting called for interfering on Florida forward Mason Marchment. The Stars stretched their lead to 4-1 with just 1:21 expired in the third period. Robertson picked up a loose puck in the neutral zone and skated in before letting loose from the slot, roofing his shot over Bobrovskys glove. His goal was unassisted."

Crenshaw, 37, is a Navy veteran who lost his right eye and suffered damage to his left eye in 2012 when a homemade bomb exploded when he was deployed to Afghanistan. The blast from 2012 caused a cataract, excessive tissue damage, and extensive damage to my retina, Crenshaw said in a statement. It was always a possibility that the effects of the damage to my retina would resurface, and it appears that is exactly what has happened. Crenshaw said the retina to his left eye was found to be detaching after he went to an ophthalmologist on Thursday because of dark, blurry vision, and that he underwent surgery on Friday. The surgery went well, but I will be effectively blind for about a month, according to Crenshaw. Crenshaw was reelected in November representing Texas 2nd Congressional District in the Houston area."

About 1,000 people converged Saturday on Victory Square and University Square, expressing frustration with an earlier curfew and shop closures that took effect at the end of March. Many demonstrators waved tri-color Romanian flags and chanted Freedom! and Down with the government! We came to fight against this state of alert that buries all our rights and freedoms, Dumitru Balan, leader of the civic movement Action for the Nation, told The Associated Press. The protest was held on the same day that Romania passed 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases. Hospital intensive care units are struggling to cope with the record demand of just under 1,500 COVID-19 patients; 12,000 others are in other wards. There are now very severe patients admitted in our clinical ward that normally would require intensive care  we dont have enough ICU beds available and patients are waiting with sub-optimal care, Dragos Zaharia, a pneumologist at Marius Nasta Institute, told the AP.

The pushback is coming primarily from Republican lawmakers but is not entirely partisan. GOP lawmakers are targeting both Democratic and Republican governors. When the pandemic hit a year ago, many governors and their top health officials temporarily ordered residents to remain home, limited public gatherings, prohibited in-person schooling and shut down dine-in restaurants, gyms and other businesses. Many governors have been repealing or relaxing restrictions after cases declined from a winter peak and as more people get vaccinated. The potential remains in many states for governors to again tighten restrictions if new variants of the coronavirus lead to another surge in cases. The U.S. has recorded 31 million coronavirus cases and more than 561,000 confirmed deaths, the most in the world. WINDOW ROCK, Ariz.  Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez has vetoed a a resolution to reopen tribal roads on the Navajo reservation to tourists and other visitors amid the pandemic. Nez says he vetoed the resolution approved March 31 by the Navajo Nation Council because COVID-19 variants are spreading in the region and more people need to be vaccinated to move closer to herd immunity and this will take time. I understand that people want to travel and visit our sites here on the Navajo Nation, but we have to prioritize the health and well-being of our people, Nez added. The closure doesnt impact state highways that pass through the reservation, which includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. SPOKANE, Wash.  Nearly 70 state business organizations are urging Washington Gov. Jay Inslee to delay for three weeks any decision to return some counties to more restrictive coronavirus standards. Currently, all counties in the state are in Phase 3. Inslee says hell announce Monday if any counties must return to Phase 2 because of rising coronavirus cases. LONDON  As many as 60 countries might be stalled at the first shots of their coronavirus vaccinations because nearly all deliveries through the global program are blocked until as late as June. The COVAX initiative is designed to provide vaccines to countries lacking the clout to negotiate on their own for scarce supplies. In the past two weeks, only 2 million doses were cleared for shipment to 92 countries through the program, the same amount injected in Britain alone. Internal World Health Organization documents obtained by The Associated Press say uncertain deliveries are causing some countries to lose faith in COVAX. The vaccine shortage stems mostly from Indias decision to stop exporting vaccines from its Serum Institute factory because of a surge of coronavirus cases in that country. The factory produces the majority of the AstraZeneca doses that COVAX counted on to supply about a third of the global population. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus says while one in four people in rich countries had received a vaccine, only one in 500 people in poorer countries had received a dose. CLARKSDALE, Miss.  About 80 older adults have received a COVID-19 vaccination in the first mobile vaccination event hosted by the state of Mississippi. Participants were picked up by bus at senior apartment complexes in Clarksdale and driven to a community health center. Department of Human Services spokesperson Danny Blanton says places like Clarksdale are especially important to reach because of the states focus on vaccinating minorities and older adults  two groups disproportionately affected by the virus. Clarksdale is more than 80% Black. More than half a million people have been fully vaccinated in Mississippi, a state with a population around 3 million. At least 45% of those are people 65 and older. MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.  More Black Americans say they are open to taking the coronavirus vaccine. A poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in late March found about 24% of Black American adults say they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. Thats down from 41% in January. The executive director of the American Public Health Association,Dr. Georges Benjamin, says attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken almost a 180-degree turnaround as outreach campaigns have sought to combat misinformation. Mattie Pringle had doubts about taking the coronavirus vaccine. The 57-year-old from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared her underlying health conditions might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. She made an appointment to get a vaccine after a member of her church, who is a local NAACP leader, shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots is now nearly the same as white Americans at 26% and Hispanic Americans at 22%. TEHRAN, Iran -- State TV reports that Iran has begun a 10-day lockdown amid a fourth wave of coronavirus infections. Irans coronavirus task force ordered most shops closed and offices were restricted to one-third capacity in cities declared as red-zones. The Health Ministry says there were more than 19,600 new infections on Saturday and 193 confirmed deaths. More than 85% of the country has either a red or orange infection status, authorities say. The severe surge in infections follows a two-week public holiday for Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Millions traveled to the Caspian coast and other popular vacation spots in defiance of government health guidelines. Only some 200,000 doses have been administered in the country of 84 million, according to the World Health Organization. The confirmed death toll has reached more than 64,200. BUCHAREST, Romania  Romania passed one million confirmed COVID-19 infections since its first recorded case in February last year. The bleak milestone comes as hospital intensive care units (ICU) in the country  which has a population of more than 19 million  are struggling to cope with record numbers of ICU patients, currently just short of 1,500. Another 12,000 COVID-19 patients are receiving hospital care. Its a situation we havent encountered until now in Romania, Beatrice Mahler, the manager at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumology, told The Associated Press. Extremely ill patients who arrive with low (oxygen) saturation levels and need an ICU bed  but the number of beds is really limited. Romania has administered more than 3.5 million vaccine doses. There have been more than 25,000 total confirmed coronavirus deaths. WARSAW, Poland  At least six people were detained Saturday during anti-lockdown protest in Warsaw by about 100 angry businessmen. They held the protest near a downtown square where state ceremonies were taking place to mark the 2010 plane crash that killed then-president, Lech Kaczynski, and 95 others. Participants in the protest, coming from across Poland, threw smoke grenades and chanted to vent their ire at the lockdown that they say is threatening their livelihoods. They were confronted by police on foot and on horseback and at least six persons were detained, according to Warsaw police spokesman Sylwester Marczak. NEW DELHI  Multiple Indian states are warning the federal government of COVID-19 vaccine shortages as another spike in cases threatens to overrun the country and its already-feeble medical infrastructure. Authorities in New Delhi and in Punjab and Rajasthan states said Saturday that they would not be able to continue vaccinations in the coming days unless stocks were replenished. Earlier this week, western Maharashtra state, the epicenter of the countrys outbreak, closed some vaccination centers and turned people away due to inadequate vaccine supplies. Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said the country has enough doses and urged state governments to put an end to fearmongering. India, a major vaccine manufacturer, has so far administered 97 million shots but is facing major supply snags as it works to inoculate a huge population of nearly 1.4 billion people. Vaccine shots are currently limited to people over age 45 and frontline workers. Prime Minister Narendra Modis opponents have blamed his government for exporting tens of millions of vaccine doses instead of focusing on immunizations at home. India has exported 64.5 million vaccine doses of vaccines to other nations. It stopped exports last week to prioritize domestic needs. BEIJING  China reported 14 new confirmed coronavirus cases and no deaths on Saturday. All the new infections were believed to have been acquired abroad, the National Health Commission said. The countrys death toll stood at 4,636 out of 90,400 confirmed cases. WINDOW ROCK, Ariz.  The Navajo Nation has issued a stay-at-home order for the weekend after reporting 26 more confirmed COVID-19 cases. The latest figures bring the total number of cases on the tribes reservation, which includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, to 30,239. No additional deaths were reported. The current death toll is 1,260. The weekend stay-at-home order follows an increase of infections and the announcement this week of the first confirmed case of the COVID-19 B.1.429 variant on the Navajo Nation. The variant was first identified in the state of California and has since been detected across the southwest U.S. NEW YORK  Pfizer wants to allow more adolescents to receive the vaccine. New York-based Pfizer and BioNTech SE of Germany have asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand the emergency use authorization for their vaccine to include adolescents ages 12 through 15. Back in mid-December, the two-dose shot received emergency clearance for vaccinating people ages 16 and up. Pfizer and BioNTech said they are working closely with the FDA and regulators in other countries to get emergency or conditional authorization as quickly as possible for kids ages 12 through 15. The companies noted in a statement that preliminary results through March 31 from late-stage testing in that age group found the vaccine safe and 100% effective in blocking infections. They said side effects were consistent with those from testing of volunteers ages 16 through 25: pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, fever and nausea. All participants in the study of 12- through 15-year-old volunteers will be monitored for two years, starting after they received their second dose, to watch for any safety issues and determine how long the vaccine protects recipients. GENEVA  European regulators are reviewing Johnson & Johnsons COVID-19 vaccine for unusual blood clots similar to the possible risk from another vaccine, the one made by AstraZeneca. Earlier this week, the European Medicines Agency cited a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a rare clotting disorder. The J&J vaccine is made with a similar technology, prompting questions about the possibility of similar side effects. The European group said Friday that it is investigating four reports of unusual clots, one in a J&J study and the others during the U.S. rollout of the one-dose vaccine. Before clearing the J&J shot for U.S. use, the Food and Drug Administration investigated the clot that occurred during testing. At the time, the FDA said it would monitor for any red flags as the vaccine was used more widely. Earlier this week, the European regulators said there have been three additional U.S. reports of clots with some similarities, out of almost 5 million vaccine recipients. The EMA on Friday reiterated that its not clear if the small number of J&J reports are linked to the vaccine, which is expected to roll out in Europe in a few weeks. In a statement Friday, J&J said no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the vaccine, but that it continued to work closely with regulators to assess the data."

            "content": "U.S. News PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Former President Donald Trump staked his claim to the Republican Party in a closed-door speech to donors Saturday night, casting his populist policies and attack-dog politics as the key to future Republican success. Trump also reinforced his commitment to the GOP in his address, according to prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press, which comes as Republican officials seek to downplay an intraparty feud over Trumps role in the party, his commitment to GOP fundraising and his plans for 2024. While Trumps advisers report he will emphasize party unity, he rarely sticks to script. The key to this triumphant future will be to build on the gains our amazing movement has made over the past four years, Trump told hundreds of leading Republican donors, according to the prepared remarks. Under our leadership, we welcomed millions upon millions of new voters into the Republican coalition. We transformed the Republican Party into a party that truly fights for all Americans. The former president delivered his remarks behind closed doors at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, in the final address of the Republican National Committees weekend donor summit in Palm Beach. Most of the RNCs invitation-only weekend gathering was set at a luxury hotel four miles away, but attendees were bused to Trumps club for his remarks. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to address donors Saturday night as well. Earlier in the weekend, a slew of candidates already positioning themselves for a 2024 presidential run made appearances. Besides DeSantis, the potential White House contenders included South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also spoke. In his remarks Friday night, Cotton leaned into the GOPs culture wars, attacking the Democrats positions on transgender youth, voter ID laws and Major League Baseballs decision to move its All-Star Game to protest Republican voting laws  just as Trump does in his prepared remarks. While a significant faction of the Republican Party hopes to move past Trumps divisive leadership, the location of the weekend gathering suggests that the GOP, at least for now, is not ready to replace Trump as its undisputed leader and chief fundraiser. Trumps team reports that his remarks are intended to reinforce his continued leadership role in Republican affairs, a sharp break from past presidents. Saturdays speech will be welcomed words to the Republican donors visiting Mar-a-Lago to hear directly from President Trump, Trump adviser Jason Miller said. Palm Beach is the new political power center, and President Trump is the Republican Partys best messenger. Despite Saturdays intended message, Trumps commitment to the GOP is far from certain. Earlier in the year, he raised the possibility of creating a new political party. And just a month ago, Trumps political action committee sent letters to the RNC and others asking them to immediately cease and desist the unauthorized use of President Donald J. Trumps name, image, and/or likeness in all fundraising, persuasion, and/or issue speech. GOP officials have repeatedly tried to downplay the fundraising tensions and see Trumps participation as a sign that he is willing to lend his name to the party. At the same time, Trump continues to aggressively accumulate campaign cash to fuel his own political ambitions. Trump has also regularly attacked his Republican critics in recent weeks, especially Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and No. 3 House Republican Liz Cheney. Neither attended the weekend donor summit. Trump did not attack Cheney or McConnell  or any Republicans  in Saturdays speech, at least according to his scripted remarks."

            "content": "KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP)  People who ignored an initial warning to evacuate the area closest to a volcano on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent raced to get clear Saturday, a day after it erupted with an explosion that shook the ground, spewed ash skyward and blanketed the island in a layer of fine volcanic rock. The eruption Friday of La Soufrire  its first large one since 1979  transformed the islands lush towns and villages into gloomy, gray versions of themselves. A strong sulfur smell was unavoidable Saturday and ash covered everything, creeping into homes, cars and noses, and obscuring the sunshine that makes the island so popular with tourists. Chellise Rogers, who lives in the village of Biabou, which is in an area of St. Vincent thats considered safe, said she could hear continuous rumbling. Its exhilarating and scary at the same time, she said. (Its the) first time I am witnessing a volcano eruption. Scientists warn that the explosions could continue for days or even weeks, and that the worst could be yet to come. The first bang is not necessarily the biggest bang this volcano will give, Richard Robertson, a geologist with the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Center, said during a news conference. About 16,000 people have had to flee their ash-covered communities with as many belongings as they could stuff into suitcases and backpacks. However, there have been no reports of anyone being killed or injured by the initial blast or those that followed. Before it blew, the government ordered people to evacuate the most high-risk area around the 4,003-foot (1,220-meter) volcano after scientists warned that magma was moving close to the surface. Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of the 32 islands that make up the country of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said on local station NBC Radio that people should remain calm, be patient and keep trying to protect themselves from the coronavirus. He said officials were trying to figure out the best way to collect and dispose of the ash, which covered an airport runway near the capital of Kingstown, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south, and fell as far away as Barbados, about 120 miles (190 kilometers) to the east. Its difficult to breathe, the prime minister said, adding that although the volcano was venting less, a big plume of ash remained. What goes up, must come down. Although Gonsalves said it could take up to four months for life to return to normal, hes confident it will. Agriculture will be badly affected, and we may have some loss of animals, and we will have to do repairs to houses. But if we have life and we have strength  we will build it back better, stronger, together, he said. People who didnt heed the initial evacuation order hurried to do so Saturday. At least a few ash-covered evacuees escaped in small boats and headed to other parts of the main island, which makes up 90% of the countrys total land. About 3,200 people took refuge at 78 government-run shelters, and four empty cruise ships stood ready to take other evacuees to nearby islands, with a group of more than 130 already taken to St. Lucia. Those staying at the shelters were tested for COVID-19, with anyone testing positive being taken to an isolation center. Nearby nations, including Antigua and Grenada, also offered to take in evacuees. On Saturday, some people swept outside their homes and taped their doors and windows shut in the hopes of keeping out the ash. Were hearing rumbling from here and witnessed the lightning flashes last night, said Rukersha Jackson, a 22-year-old marketing specialist who lives with her family a little outside the mandatory evacuation zone. That zone covers the northern third of St. Vincent and is on the opposite side than Kingstown, where most of the countrys more than 100,000 people live. The ash has forced the cancellation of several flights, and poor visibility limited evacuations in some areas. Officials warned that St. Lucia to the north and Grenada to the south could get light ash fall, though most of it was expected to head northeast into the Atlantic Ocean. Although the ash can seem scary, it wont harm healthy people in the short term, said Claire Horwell, a professor at Durham University in the United Kingdom who will be analyzing the ash emitted by La Soufrire. She recommended that people wear face masks, long sleeves and pants to avoid irritation. Volcanic ash looks really scary, and it is really terrifying to people who have never been exposed to it before, but for most healthy people, it is more of a nuisance, said Horwell, who is also director of the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network. However, she warned that the ash and gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, could affect asthmatics and others with chronic health conditions. La Soufrire last had a sizable eruption in 1979. An eruption in 1902 killed roughly 1,600 people. The volcano had a minor eruption in December, which led regional experts to fly in to analyze the formation of a new volcanic dome and changes to its crater lake, among other things. The eastern Caribbean has 19 live volcanoes, including two underwater near Grenada. One of those, Kick Em Jenny, has been active in recent years. But the most active volcano of all is Soufrire Hills in Montserrat. It has erupted continuously since 1995, razing the capital of Plymouth and killing at least 19 people in 1997.

(AP)  Georgias Republican governor on Saturday stepped up his attack on Major League Baseballs decision to pull this summers All-Star Game from the state in response to a sweeping new voting law, saying the move politicized the sport and would hurt minority-owned businesses. Its minority-owned businesses that have been hit harder than most because of an invisible virus by no fault of their own, Gov. Brian Kemp said. And these are the same minority businesses that are now being impacted by another decision that is by no fault of their own. Kemp spoke along with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, also a Republican, at a seafood and poboy restaurant miles from the stadium in a suburb north of Atlanta where the game would have been held, though he said he didnt think the restaurant was minority-owned. He has previously criticized MLBs decision. The game will now be played in Denver. Kemp noted at Saturdays news conference that Denver has a much smaller percentage of African Americans than Atlanta. And he said MLBs move has injected politics into the great American pastime. People shouldnt have to go to the game and worry about if theyre sitting next to a Joe Biden supporter or a Donald Trump supporter, he said. They ought to be able to go to the game, cheer for their team just like if youre in church worshipping. Critics say its the voting law thats political and will disproportionately affect communities of color. Kemps news conference was trying to deflect from that, as the governor gears up for next years election to try to win a second term, said Aklima Khondoker, state director of the voting rights group, All Voting is Local. Hes pivoting away from all of the malicious things that we understand that this bill represents to people of color in Georgia, she said. About two dozen protesters turned out near Augusta National on Saturday, holding signs that said Let Us Vote and Protect Georgia Voting Rights. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has said he made the decision to move the All-Star events after discussions with individual players and the Players Alliance, an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year, and that the league opposed restrictions to the ballot box. A MLB spokesman said the league had no immediate additional comment Saturday. Several groups already have filed suit over the voting measure, which includes strict identification requirements for voting absentee by mail. It expands weekend early voting, but limits the use of ballot drop boxes, makes it a crime to hand out food or water to voters waiting in line and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. That has led to concerns that the Republican-controlled state board could exert more influence over the administration of elections, including the certification of county results. The rewrite of Georgias election rules  signed by Kemp last month  follows former President Donald Trumps repeated, baseless claims of fraud after his presidential loss to Biden. Democrats have assailed the law as an attempt to suppress Black and Latino votes, with Biden calling it Jim Crow in the 21st Century. Carr and Kemp blasted that comparison. This made up narrative that this bill takes us back to Jim Crow  an era when human beings were being killed and who were truly prevented from casting their vote  is preposterous, Carr said. It is irresponsible, and its fundamentally wrong."

The group held signs that said Let Us Vote and Protect Georgia Voting Rights, drawing both jeers and cheers from motorists on busy Washington Road. One man passing by shouted an insult against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who signed new voter restrictions into law last month. But another yelled at protesters, Cmon, you can vote! Get out of here! Georgias law  which opponents say is designed to reduce the impact of minority voters by making it more difficult to cast a ballot  has drawn fire from around the country. Major League Baseball yanked this summers All-Star Game out of Atlanta to shows its displeasure with the new statute. There were calls to take the Masters from Augusta National, but the club ignored the outcry and its chairman, on the eve of golfs first major championship in 2021, declined to take a stand on the bill. Georgia played a critical role in the last years election, narrowly going for Joe Biden in the presidential race. He was the first Democrat to carry the state since 1992. Also, the states two incumbent Republican senators were defeated in a runoff by Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, giving Democrats control of the U.S. Senate. Nearly 5 million Georgians cast ballots, many using absentee or early voting methods. The last election had a record turnout, said one of the protesters, Marla Cureton of Roswell in suburban Atlanta, who is part of a womens activist group known as No Safe Seats. We should be celebrating this. Its a great thing. Instead, the GOP-controlled state Legislature passed a law that supporters say is designed to improve election security following baseless allegations by former President Donald Trump that he lost Georgia because of widespread fraud. Other states around the country are considering similar laws. Among other things, the Georgia law imposes additional identification requirements for absentee voting, gives the GOP-run state elections board new powers to intervene in local election offices, and restricts the distribution of water and food to voters standing in long lines. This bill is death by a thousand cuts, Cureton said. Anytime you put new restrictions on how you can vote, thats voter suppression. We should be making it easier to vote. Its the patriotic thing to do. She said the protesters staked out a corner about a half-mile from the front gate of Augusta National to bring attention to their cause. We have to keep awareness up, Cureton said. Its important in Georgia that people understand its not going away.

            "content": "LONDON (AP)  British authorities have implored people to stay away from royal palaces as they mourn the death of Prince Philip in this time of COVID-19, but they keep coming. Not just to honor him, but to support Queen Elizabeth II, who lost her husband of 73 years. The mix included children, seniors, Sikhs and the children of African immigrants. A cross-section of British society and admirers from abroad descended on Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle on Saturday. They laid bouquets at the gates, offered prayers or just paused for a moment of reflection as they remembered a man who dedicated much of his life to public service. Mourners talked about Philips work with some 780 charities and organizations, particularly his Duke of Edinburgh Award, which seeks to build confidence and resilience in young people. But they also recalled his role as the consummate royal consort, supporting the queen at thousands of public engagements and state visits. We had a really hard year all of us and theres people uniting in a very special moment, said Carolina Przeniewska, originally from Poland, who came to Buckingham Place with her 5-year-old daughter Grace. So I wanted her to see it and I wanted to pay respect. At Buckingham Palace, the queens London residence, well-wishers braved a chilly, gray day to line up and snake their way past the black iron gates, where tourists normally wait to watch the changing of the guard. People were allowed to approach the gates one at a time to lay their tributes as police tried to control the crowd amid Britains coronavirus restrictions. The crowd was smaller at Windsor Castle, west of the capital, where a steady stream of mourners quietly approached the gates to leave bright spring bouquets on a strip of lawn. People want to show their respect for both Philip and the queen, who turns 95 this month and will celebrate 70 years on the throne next year, said Nick Bullen, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of True Royalty TV. If the queen wasnt already loved enough, this is just going to move it to another level now, Bullen said. This is a woman whos going to bury her husband and then in a matter of days later be celebrating her birthday and stepping into her platinum jubilee year.  So I think people will just be rallying around the queen as much as they will the Duke of Edinburgh. Philip, the son of a Greek prince, and the future queen first met as teenagers. They were married in 1947 when she was 21 and he was a 26-year-old naval officer. Elizabeth became queen when her father died in 1952. At her coronation, Philip swore to be his wifes liege man of life and limb and settled into a life of supporting the monarch. Philip retired from public life in 2017. At the time, he had conducted more than 22,000 public engagements on his own, given 5,496 speeches and made 637 solo trips abroad, in addition to countless more appearances by the queens side. He was a hero to me because he was the man I could look up to, Nurtr Omar, a 20-year-old who was born in Somalia and now lives in Britain, said outside Buckingham Palace. He showed me what I can achieve with my life, whether you are royal or not. You need to make hard work to achieve what you want to. The floral tributes grew throughout the day, even after the Royal Family on Friday asked people not to visit royal residences to pay their respects due to public health concerns. Instead of flowers, the family asked people to consider making donations to charity. But for Windsor resident Billy Dohil, the day was about history. He took his children to the castle so they could be part of it. As they grow up, well remember this, Dohil, 39, said. Well remember the royal family and (it) will be part of their life. So we wanted to come here to pay our respects. My oldest son  five years old  wanted to bring some flowers and just put it down himself.

            "content": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP)  Xander Schauffele is in what has become familiar territory. Hes close to the top of the leaderboard in a major championship. Hes hoping Sunday isnt more of the same when it comes to finishes. Schauffele shot a 4-under 68 on Saturday to get to 7 under through three rounds of the Masters, leaving him four shots back of Hideki Matsuyama going into the final round. Hes had five top-five finishes in majors, including a tie for second -- one shot behind winner Tiger Woods  at Augusta National in 2019. And now comes another chance for a major breakthrough. I think Im playing really good golf, Schauffele said. I was excited for today after yesterday, some of the iron shots I was able to hit. Im excited for tomorrow as well. Hes had chances before. Schauffele briefly was atop the leaderboard on the back nine at Augusta National in 2019, but failed to make birdie on the par-5 15th and wound up losing to Woods by one. He didnt even seem disappointed then, almost thrilled to be part of witnessing history. And in 2018, he was tied for the lead going into the final round of the British Open  losing there by two shots to Francesco Molinari. Its all part of the process, Schauffele said. Im a huge fan of putting myself in position with nine holes to go and learning from each and every mistake, and also the things I did well in those moments. Looking forward to tomorrow. Schauffele is in a cluster of four players at 7 under, joined by Marc Leishman, Justin Rose and Will Zalatoris. Schauffele caught perhaps a bit of a break at the par-4 18th when his approach skipped right of the green and toward the spectators, his ball stopping only after hitting the leg of someones chair. He salvaged par to remain in the tie for second. It was a good spot, Schauffele said. He and Matsuyama were on the 11th hole when play was halted for a little more than an hour as a line of thunderstorms made its way into the area. The delay didnt slow him down; he made birdie on the par-5 13th, then rolled in a 60-footer for eagle on the par-5 15th. That putt temporarily pulled him even with Matsuyama; his playing partner rolled in a 5-footer for eagle at the 15th moments later, then made birdie on his next two holes as well. I was happy to make my 60-foot eagle putt on 15, Schauffele said. I knew Hideki was going to make his. I was just trying to stay in touch. Schauffele is 8 under on the par 5s this week, 1 over on everything else. But he has also avoided the big mistake, and had his best scoring round of the week on a day where he missed seven greens and six fairways  his worst showing of the week in both areas. In other words, hes had to fight to stay close. My dinner will taste a little better, he said as night fell on Augusta National after the third round. I had a few putts coming down the stretch, one on 16 and up-and-down on 17 and another one on 18. So it wasnt quite as nice as Hidekis cleanup there on the last few holes, but Ill take it. The 27-year-old Schauffele also has four top-six finishes in the U.S. Open, more proof that he can stay close in the toughest events. And he has perspective as well. Golf consists of a bunch of losers, unfortunately, Schauffele said earlier in Masters week. Theres only one guy that wins every week, and thats how sports works. I think for my mental sanity it would be helpful for me to be a more consistent player. His major consistency is there. The major win might arrive Sunday.

            "content": "CARY, N.C. (AP)  Trinity Rodman became the youngest player to score in the National Womens Soccer League with a goal in her professional debut for the Washington Spirit on Saturday night. But the Spirit could not overcome the North Carolina Courage, falling 3-2 in the Challenge Cup match. Rodman, the 18-year-old daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, was the second overall pick in the NWSL draft earlier this year. A standout on the U.S. youth national teams, she decided to go pro before her freshman season at Washington State. My team has helped me a lot, obviously, being a really young player and very new, its definitely a lot faster, girls are a lot stronger, a lot more intelligent, at this level, Rodman said. I think just getting advice from my teammates in scrimmages and practices, Ive been able to kind of think ahead. And I think thats a huge part of whats helped me in the game.  The NWSLs Challenge Cup kicked off Friday. Each of the leagues 10 teams are divided in two divisions, with the title game set for May 8. The leagues regular season opens on May 15. Kumi Yokoyama also scored for the Spirit in the game. Kristen Hamilton, Jessica McDonald and Merritt Mathias each scored for the Courage. Rodman scored in the 60th minute after coming in off the bench. Afterward, Spirit Coach Richie Burke was brimming with praise for his rookie. The kid is just brilliant. Shes a machine as an athlete, just unbelievable, Burke said. When you play against her, you train with her, you see how quickly she closes you down. Shes deceptively quick to close you down. But now shes getting tactically better, too. Rodman has been vocal in the past about wanting to forge her own path in womens soccer, separate from her Hall of Fame fathers legacy. Her brother DJ Rodman plays basketball for Washington State. In Saturdays other Challenge Cup match, Cece Kizer scored Racing Louisvilles first-ever goal in the expansion teams 2-2 draw with the Orlando Pride. Racings Brooke Hendrix scored a stoppage time goal to deny the Pride the victory at Louisvilles Lynn Family Stadium. Players from the U.S. national team were not with their NWSL club teams because of a European trip during the FIFA competition window. The United States played to a 1-1 draw with Sweden earlier Saturday in Stockholm. More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

United can consolidate second place with a win at seventh-place Tottenham, which won 6-1 at Old Trafford at the start of the season. Four points separate third-place Leicester and West Ham, which dropped to sixth after Saturdays results. Chelsea and Liverpool are between them. Newcastle is three points clear of the bottom three going into its match at Burnley, while last-place Sheffield United is on the verge of relegation ahead of a home game against Arsenal. Atltico Madrid needs at least a point from its visit to sixth-place Real Betis to regain the lead in the Spanish league. Real Madrid moved to the top  thanks to a better head-to-head tiebreaker  after beating Barcelona 2-1 in the clsico in Madrid on Saturday. Barcelona stayed one point behind the Madrid city rivals. Seeking its first league title since 2014, Atltico has won only one of its last three league matches. Also Sunday, Valencia hosts fifth-place Real Sociedad and Granada visits relegation-threatened Valladolid. It will be Valencias first match since defender Mouctar Diakhaby accused an opponent of racially insulting him last weekend. Inter Milan is aiming for an 11th straight win to restore its 11-point lead atop Serie A when it hosts relegation-threatened Cagliari. Behind it there is a tight battle for second place. AC Milan currently occupies that position and won 3-1 at Parma on Saturday. But Juventus can move to within a point of the Rossoneri with a win at home to Genoa. Atalanta is just a point behind Juve and visits Fiorentina while fifth-place Napoli travels to Sampdoria. Lazio and Roma are also within sight of the top four and the Champions League places. Lazio and Roma play Hellas Verona and Bologna respectively. It looks like a huge mismatch as third-place Monaco hosts last-place Dijon. While Monaco has lost once in the last 19 games overall, Dijon is facing a 13th straight defeat. Fourth-place Lyon has a tougher-looking home game against midtable Angers. Lyon, which is one point behind Monaco in the chase for a Champions League spot, will be without midfielder Houssem Aouar and forward Tino Kadewere. They are both injured. Fifth-place Lens has five players out due to coronavirus for the home game against Lorient. Rennes continues its push for fifth and a Europa League spot against visiting Nantes. Nantes won the last of its eight league titles 20 years ago but is now languishing in 19th place. Nantes coach Antoine Kombouare played down a locker room clash with captain Nicolas Pallois, saying it was a healthy part of the game. The Bundesligas relegation fight heats up with last-place Schalke hosting Augsburg before Cologne welcomes Mainz. Mainz can leave the relegation zone with a win, and it has looked a different outfit since Bo Svensson took over as coach. Svenssons team is unbeaten in four games. Cologne is 17th in the 18-team division  two points below Mainz  and on a seven-game winless run since beating Borussia Mnchengladbach. Schalke is 16 points from safety with seven games to play but the Gelsenkirchen-based club still has pride at stake as it prepares for life in the second division. A win over 11th-place Augsburg would be just the teams second league win in a season that Schalke fans will want to forget.

Heres what happened: Play was suspended around 4 p.m. because of dangerous weather in the area, and Finau went to the caddie house to wait for the resumption of play. Thats when Jimmy Dunne, an Augusta National member, just happened to be on the phone with Brady  the seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback, the most recent of those coming earlier this year with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Dunne approached Finau and said, somebody wants to talk to you. Somebody was Brady. That was a pleasant surprise, Finau said. He said great playing, and hes following. He said hes surprised we stopped. He said, in the NFL, When it rains, we dont stop. I said, Maybe were not as tough as you guys, and he said, No, thats not the case. We had a good laugh about that. He was giving me some crap about the weather and why we stopped. He was obviously watching, and that was cool he was following. Brady is a big-time golfer and golf fan. He played last year in The Match: Champions for Charity, teaming with Phil Mickelson against Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning. The made-for-TV event raised $20 million. Finau is friends with Bradys longtime trainer, Alex Guerrero. Alex is one of my good friends and someone Ive known for a little bit, Finau said. Thats kind of how we met in Boston when he was playing for the Patriots, and this is only the second time weve had a conversation. Finau is a big football fan, but never was a serious player. He was asked if Brady, who has been known to recruit a free agent or two, asked him about joining the Bucs. Hes got plenty of weapons over there in Tampa, Finau said. Theyre not going to need me.

            "content": "One stoppage-time goal slowed Manchester Citys march to the Premier League title. Another ignited Liverpools push for the Champions League qualification positions. A day of dramatic finishes in Englands top flight began with City losing 2-1 to 10-man Leeds, whose winning goal  scored by Stuart Dallas for his second of the match  came from a breakaway in the first minute of added-on time at Etihad Stadium. Citys fourth league defeat of the season should only delay the inevitable as it closes in on regaining the title. Pep Guardiolas team leads by 14 points with six matches remaining, though second-place Manchester United has two games in hand. At Anfield, Liverpool was heading for another disappointing result at home when right back Trent Alexander-Arnold curled a stunning effort into the corner also in the first minute of stoppage time to secure a 2-1 win against Aston Villa. Liverpool, which had lost its last six league games at Anfield, moved into fifth place and stayed two points behind Chelsea, which jumped to fourth after a 4-1 win at Crystal Palace in Saturdays other game. American international Christian Pulisic scored twice for Chelsea at Selhurst Park. West Ham started the day in fourth place but dropped to sixth ahead of its match against third-place Leicester on Sunday. There was a two-minute silence before all of the games to honor Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Leeds played the entire second half against City with 10 men after the sending-off of center back Liam Cooper for a tackle on Gabriel Jesus that saw him get the ball but follow through, with his studs showing, into the strikers leg. The red card turned what had been an end-to-end game into one resembling a training-ground exercise of attack vs. defense, with Leeds bidding to protect a 42nd-minute lead earned by Dallas after a mistake by Joao Cancelo. Leeds, one of the Premier Leagues flair teams, demonstrated unlikely resilience to hold off City until Ferran Torres goal in the 76th but Dallas had the final say. He ran onto a pass from Ezgjan Alioski, pierced the center of Citys defense, and slid a low shot past Ederson. Citys dominance showed in the stats  Pep Guardiolas team had 29 shots compared to Leeds two  but that didnt translate into one of the four wins needed to regain the league trophy. Alexander-Arnold is playing with a point to prove after his recent axing by England. A week after his brilliant cross set up Liverpools opening goal in a win at Arsenal, the right back scored a crucial goal for the Reds  in front of England coach Gareth Southgate, who was at Anfield to watch the game. He has to challenge himself, but not because of the national team but because as a young player he has to challenge himself, Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said. To be in the squad of England you have to play outstandingly good football. Trent did this very often from a very young age. Liverpool rallied from conceding the opening goal in the 43rd to Ollie Watkins, who scored a hat trick in Villas 7-2 win over Klopps team in October. Mohamed Salah equalized in the 57th with his 19th goal of the league campaign, putting him tied in first place with Harry Kane. With Pulisic also scoring in Chelseas surprising 5-2 loss to West Bromwich Albion last weekend, he now has three goals in two league games and 13 goals overall in the English top flight. That leaves him tied with Roy Wegerle for third among American players. Kai Havertz and Kurt Zouma were the other scorers for Chelsea, which is two points behind Leicester and two ahead of Liverpool and West Ham. Leicester visits West Ham on Sunday.

            "content": "U.S. News MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The murder trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyds death has introduced viewers from around the world to a vast array of defense and prosecution tactics aimed at swaying the jury. Some strategies and terms that have become part of Derek Chauvins trial are rare outside criminal courtrooms. The Associated Press has taken closer looks into them to better explain what viewers are seeing and hearing. Video shows Chauvin pinning Floyd to the ground, his knee on his neck, as Floyd yelled I cant breathe before his body went limp last May 25. But defense attorneys are tasked with casting doubt on whether the former officer was directly responsible for the Black mans death. Theyve sought to argue that other factors, such as drug use, may have killed him. A medical examiner concluded last year that Floyds heart stopped, complicated by how police restrained him and compressed his neck. However, narrowed arteries, high blood pressure, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use also were listed on the death certificate as other contributing conditions. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker testified that those conditions didnt cause the death. Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. His lawyer, Eric Nelson, has argued that the officer followed his training and suggested that Floyd died due to use of illegal drugs and existing health conditions. Nelson has tried to play up Floyds drug use and sought to show Wednesday tat Floyd yelled I ate too many drugs as officers pinned him down. Playing a short clip from a police body camera video, Nelson asked prosecution witness Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles Police Department sergeant who served as a prosecution use-of-force expert, if he heard Floyd say: I ate too many drugs. I cant make that out, Stiger replied. Nelson later replayed it for senior special agent James Reyerson with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, who agreed thats what Floyd appeared to say. But prosecutor Matthew Frank replayed a longer clip from the same body cam video that put Floyds statement into broader context. Reyerson replied: I believe Mr. Floyd was saying, I aint do no drugs. Experts and other Minneapolis officers have testified that the force used to subdue and detain Floyd on the pavement was excessive. This past week, jurors were told about the concept of excited delirium, a term one of the officers at the scene is heard on police body camera asking as a panicked Floyd writhed and claimed to be claustrophobic as officers tried to put him in the squad car. One Minneapolis officer who trains others in medical care described the term on the stand as a combination of psychomotor agitation, psychosis, hypothermia, a wide variety of other things you might see in a person or rather bizarre behavior. An expert in forensic medicine who works as a police surgeon for the Louisville Metro Police Department in Kentucky and as a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Louisville testified Thursday that Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Extensive video evidence from surveillance cameras, cellphones and police body cameras of Floyds death may be the most critical part of the case for the defense and prosecution. Modern courtrooms, like the one where Chauvin is being tried, use such technology as large video screens, projectors and up-to-date software. Dr. Martin Tobin, a lung and critical care specialist at the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital and Loyola Universitys medical school in Illinois, used a computer animation to show how Floyd was held down on the pavement. It gave jurors a 360-degree view of where the officers were and what they were doing. He used a composite of pictures from a bystander video to show Chauvin pressing his knee to Floyds neck. Floyds respiratory distress was growing at that point as officers held him down on his stomach, with his hands handcuffed behind his back. The images showed how Floyd tried to use his shoulder muscles to draw breath, the doctor said. Find APs full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd"

            "content": "LONDON (AP)  American international Christian Pulisic scored twice for Chelsea in its 4-1 win at Crystal Palace that moved the team into fourth place in the Premier League on Saturday. Kai Havertz and Kurt Zouma also netted as Chelsea bounced back from a surprising 5-2 loss to West Bromwich Albion last weekend that threw the race for Champions League qualification wide open. Pulisic was a scorer against West Brom, too, and now has 13 goals overall in the Premier League  tying him with Roy Wegerle for third among American players in Englands top flight. Pulisic has scored in consecutive league games for the first time since June last year. Chelsea is only two points behind Leicester in third. Havertz put Chelsea ahead with only his second league goal since a big-money offseason move from the Bundesliga, producing a curling left-footed strike from eight meters in the eighth minute. The former Bayer Leverkusen forward had an assist within 120 seconds, too, playing in Pulisic who smashed a finish into the roof of the net from close range. Havertz almost had a goal-of-the-season contender in the 22nd minute but his volley, after a wonderful flick over Patrick Van Aanholt, was saved. A third goal did arrive in the 30th minute when Zouma headed home a free kick from Mason Mount. With Porto up next on Tuesday in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinals  Chelsea leads 2-0 from the first leg  Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel was able to withdraw Jorginho after an hour but Palace added some tension to the occasion by pulling a goal back in the 63rd. Jeffrey Schlupp made an immediate impact from the bench, crossing for Christian Benteke to grab his sixth goal of the campaign with a header which was the Eagles first effort of the match. Normal service was quickly resumed when Gary Cahill made a last-ditch block against his old club to deny Mount, but a fourth goal came in the 78th. Reece James was afforded too much space on the right by a weary home defense and Pulisic finished at the back post. There was a two-minute silence before the game to honor Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Friday at the age of 99.

            "content": "MADRID (AP)  Keeping Lionel Messi in check again in what could turn out to be his last Spanish league clsico, Real Madrid continued the impressive run which has put it at the heart of the title race. Four days after beating Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals, Madrid defeated Barcelona 2-1 on Saturday to return to the top in Spain. We have to enjoy what weve been doing. We got two very good results and it wasnt easy, Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. Being in the lead wont change anything for us. We have to keep working hard. The victory in pouring rain in the Spanish capital left Madrid tied on points with Atltico Madrid, which on Sunday can return to the top when it visits sixth-place Real Betis. Madrid is ahead of its city rival on the head-to-head tiebreaker. Barcelona, which had been unbeaten in 19 straight league games, stayed one point off the lead. The 33-year-old Messi, who reached seven straight clsicos without a goal, has his contract with Barcelona ending this season. The Argentina star expressed his desire to leave the Catalan club last year but had the request denied. Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos scored first-half goals to give Madrid its sixth straight win in all competitions. The defending league champions were coming off a 3-1 win over Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday. It was a very important victory for us, Madrid defender Nacho Fernndez said after the Barcelona match. Its always special to win a clsico, and even more when we are so close together at the top in the fight for the title. You could say today was a final, but there is still a lot left in the league. Barcelona got on the board in the second half with a goal by scar Mingueza. It nearly equalized with a shot from young substitute Ilaix Moriba that struck the crossbar in the final play of the match. We tried until the end but it wasnt possible. We almost had it in that final play, Barcelonas Sergi Roberto said. We depended on our own results had we won, but now we need to hope that our rivals stumble. We will keep fighting until the very end. This was the first time Madrid has taken the league lead since the early rounds of the competition, and it trailed Atltico by 11 points at one stage. The result ended Barcelonas six-match winning streak in the league. It had won nine away matches in a row in the competition. It was an even start at the Alfredo Di Stfano Stadium in Madrids training center, but the hosts opened the scoring in the 13th minute with Benzemas superb flicked shot from close range after a low cross by Lucas Vzquez. The French striker, who has scored 10 goals in his last nine matches, got in front of Barcelona defender Ronald Arajo and flicked the ball toward the net with his back foot. He hadnt scored against Barcelona in nine consecutive clsicos. The Catalan club complained of a foul by Vzquez on Messi just moments before the opening goal. Kroos added to the lead in the 28th from a free kick following a foul on Vincius Jnior, who was coming off an outstanding performance in Madrids win over Liverpool. Kroos shot from just outside the area and the ball was deflected by American defender Sergio Dest before going into the net. Madrid almost added to the lead in the 34th when Federico Valverde hit the post after a breakaway led by Vincius Jnior, who also hit the post in the second half. That was after Barcelona pulled one back in the 60th with a shot from inside the area by Mingueza after a low cross by Jordi Alba. Madrid played the final minutes a man down after Casemiro was sent off with a second yellow card. One of Messis best chances was with a corner kick that curled across the area and hit Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois far post in first-half stoppage time. Messis free kick in second-half stoppage time was easily stopped by Courtois. The visitors complained about being denied a penalty in the final minutes, with Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman saying it was a clear penalty. I dont know why there is VAR in Spain, he said. Madrid got the win despite a depleted defense  with the absence of central defenders Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos. Barcelona was without the injured Gerard Piqu. Right back Vzquez, who has been key for Madrid in recent games, had to be replaced due to an injury before halftime. Barcelonas next match is the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, while Madrid travels to England to play Liverpool again in the Champions League on Wednesday. Juan Cala, who last weekend was accused of racially insulting Valencia defender Mouctar Diakhaby, played from the start in Cdizs 1-0 win at Getafe. Cala denied any wrongdoing and the Spanish league said Friday it had not found evidence to support Diakhabys accusation against the Cdiz player. Athletic Bilbao was held 0-0 at home by second-to-last Alavs to extend its winless streak to five matches in all competitions. The winless run of last-place Eibar reached 14 matches after a 1-0 home loss to eighth-place Levante.

            "content": "YANGON (AP)  At least 82 people were killed in one day in a crackdown by Myanmar security forces on pro-democracy protesters, according to reports Saturday from independent local media and an organization that keeps track of casualties since the February coup. Fridays death toll in Bago was the biggest one-day total for a single city since March 14, when just over 100 people were killed in Yangon, the countrys biggest city. Bago is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Yangon. The Associated Press is unable to independently verify the number of deaths. The death toll of 82 was a preliminary one compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which issues daily counts of casualties and arrests from the crackdown in the aftermath of the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Their tallies are widely accepted as highly credible because cases are not added until they have been confirmed, with the details published on their website. In its Saturday report, the group said that it expected the number of dead in Bago to rise as more cases were verified. The online news site Myanmar Now also reported that 82 people had been killed, citing an unnamed source involved with charity rescue work. Myanmar Now and other local media said the bodies had been collected by the military and dumped on the grounds of a Buddhist pagoda. At least 701 protesters and bystanders have been killed by security forces since the armys takeover, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The attack on Bago was the third in the past week involving the massive use of force to try to crush the persistent opposition to the ruling junta. Attacks were launched Wednesday on hardcore opponents of military rule who had set up strongholds in the towns of Kalay and Taze in the countrys north. In both places, at least 11 people -- possibly including some bystanders -- were reported killed. The security forces were accused of using heavy weapons in their attacks, including rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, though such allegations could not be independently confirmed by The Associated Press. Photos posted on social media from Bago appeared to show fragments of mortar shells. Most protests in cities and town around the country are carried out by nonviolent demonstrators who consider themselves part of a civil disobedience movement. But as the police and military escalated the use of lethal force, a hardcore faction of protesters armed themselves with homemade weapons such as firebombs in the name of self-defense. In Kalay, activists dubbed themselves a civil army and some equipped themselves with rudimentary hunting rifles that are traditional in the remote area. A report by Myanmar Now said residents of Tamu, a town in the same region as Kalay, used hunting rifles Saturday to ambush a military convoy, and claimed to kill three soldiers. The junta has taken other measures as well to discourage resistance. It recently published a wanted list of 140 people active in the arts and journalism charged with spreading information that undermines the stability of the country and the rule of law. The penalty for the offense is up to three years imprisonment. Arrests of those on the list have been highly publicized in state media. State television channel MRTV reported Friday night that a military court had sentenced to death 19 people -- 17 in absentia -- for allegedly killing an army officer in Yangon on March 27. The attack took place in an area of the city that is under martial law, and the court action appeared to be the first time the death sentence has been imposed under the juntas rule. The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, arrived Friday in the Thai capital Bangkok on a regional mission to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. She intends to sound out several Southeast Asian governments for their ideas but has been denied permission to visit Myanmar."

Current employees will have to reapply for their positions and face $15,000 pay cuts as assistant teachers. WSU staff posted on the universitys website in March that the center is losing about $150,000 annually and the changes will limit the need to raise families rates. The families said in their letter to the newspaper that the teachers are the heart of the center and all nine are working mothers with 158 combined years of experience in early childhood education. It is appalling that Winona State would end the careers of these professionals without notice, discussion or compassion, they wrote in the letter.

            "content": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Former baseball star Alex Rodriguez and e-commerce mogul Marc Lore signed a letter of intent Saturday to buy the Timberwolves and keep the NBA team in Minnesota, owner Glen Taylor said. The agreement, which also includes the WNBAs Minnesota Lynx, opens a 30-day window for negotiations to be finalized. If accountants and attorneys for both sides agree, the deal would then need to be approved by the league. The Athletic first reported the $1.5 billion sale. Under the conditions of the deal, Taylor would keep control of the club for the next two years and bring on Rodriguez and Lore as partners until a handover in 2023. In a phone interview with The Associated Press, Taylor said their connection went terrifically well and that he was happy and excited about whats to come. Theyve asked that I would be there for any decisions that would need to be made, Taylor said. I would enjoy that. I love teaching people. These are a couple of very bright guys, and I think it could be helpful to the club and I think I could be helpful to them so that they feel confident once they take over 100%. Taylor, who put the teams on the market last year, said he was first approached by Rodriguez and Lore a week ago. The pair traveled to meet Taylor and his wife at their winter home in Naples, Florida. Taylor, who turns 80 on April 20, has spoken with numerous suitors over the years but taken a deliberate approach to finding a buyer hes comfortable with. He said hes done that with Rodriguez and Lore. I was concerned if I got ill or something happened to me what would happen to the club. This gives me a path that I know its going to happen. I feel confident that theyll take care of the franchise and move it ahead, Taylor said. Throughout the sale process, he told interested parties that keeping the franchises in town was a prerequisite for purchase. There was no use talking to them if they didnt agree to that, Taylor said. The Timberwolves, who entered the league in 1989 as an expansion club, were on their way to New Orleans in 1994 before Taylor, a lifelong Minnesotan who built his fortune from a small commercial printing business, bought the team for $88 million. As part of the renovations at Target Center that were initiated in 2016, the teams lease with the city of Minneapolis carries a $50 million penalty if it were to be broken prior to 2035. Rodriguez and Lore are 50-50 partners in the deal, Taylor said. The 45-year-old Rodriguez hit 696 home runs over 22 major league seasons, with the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. His last season on the field was 2016, marking the end of marvelous career that was tainted by performance enhancing drug use he later admitted to. Rodriguez was suspended for the entire 2014 season for violating Major League Baseball policy. Lore became Walmarts e-commerce chief in 2016, when the retail giant bought his Jet.com startup in an attempt to boost online business. Lore notified Walmart on Jan. 31 of his intent to leave the company. The 49-year-old Lore will continue to serve in a consulting role as a strategic adviser through September. Rodriguez and Lore confirmed the agreement in a statement distributed to ESPN. We look forward to entering this phase of the process with Glen Taylor. Our respect for him and the legacy he has built lays an amazing foundation for what is to come. We are excited by the prospect of getting to know the Timberwolves organization, the statement said. Rodriguez was the headliner in a group that tried to purchase the New York Mets last year, before dropping out. Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen bought the club instead. The background on the biggest stages of major sports that Rodriguez has was intriguing to Taylor. I just think he understands leadership and what it takes and the different ways that you can coach and motivate people, Taylor said, and I think having him around will be helpful in the selection of the right leaders for the team.

Supporters said the legislation would help those addicted to opioids get connected to health care services fighting substance abuse. Participants would also need to show an identification card to get a syringe after an amendment was made in the Senate on Saturday, which passed it 27-7 and sent it back to the House of Delegates for potential final approval. Republican Gov. Jim Justice has not publicly commented on the bill. An email to a spokesman was not immediately returned. Republicans backing the bill said the changes were necessary due to some needle exchange programs operating so irresponsibly that they were causing syringe litter. But the new rules would take effect amid one of the nations highest spikes in HIV cases related to intravenous drug use. The surge, clustered primarily around the capital of Charleston and the city of Huntington, is being attributed at least in part to the cancellation in 2018 of a needle exchange program. City leaders and first responders complained that the program in Kanawha County led to an increase in needles being left in public places and abandoned buildings, and it was shut down. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin on Monday submitted a congressional inquiry with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the countys HIV outbreak. The West Virginia Democrat asked for the inquiry on behalf of the Kanawha County Commission two months after a CDC official warned that the countys outbreak was the most concerning in the United States. The legislation would require licenses for syringe collection and distribution programs. Operators would have to offer an array of health outreach services, including overdose prevention education and substance abuse treatment program referrals. Republican Sen. Mike Maroney said those wraparound services are the most important part of the bill. Opponents say the bills stringent measures would force existing exchange programs to close. Democratic Sen. Ron Stollings called it a knee jerk reaction to needle litter. Republican Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo said needle providers can cooperate with other organizations providing health outreach services in order to be in compliance with the proposed law. Another provision would require syringes to be marked with the program passing them out. Takubo said that could help settle once-and-for-all the question of whether exchanges lead to litter. On Friday, the House of Delegates added a provision that would give local governments the authority to bar certain groups or providers from setting up a needle exchange program. This story has been corrected to reflect that the bill has not passed the full legislature. The Senate amended the bill on Saturday morning, sending it back to the House for potential final approval before it can be transmitted to the governor for his signature."

(AP)  A former sheriffs dispatcher in a suburb of New Orleans has been arrested, accused of refusing to return more than $1.2 million that had been accidentally deposited into her brokerage account, authorities said. Kelyn Spadoni, 33, was taken into custody Wednesday on charges of theft valued over $25,000, bank fraud and illegal transmission of monetary funds, nola.com and WVUE-TV reported. The reports said she was fired by the Jefferson Parish Sheriffs Office after her arrest. Spadoni is being held at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center on a $50,000 bond. It was unknown if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf. Spadoni is accused of immediately moving the funds to another account and using some of the money to buy a new car and a house, authorities said. Authorities said a clerical error had caused Charles Schwab, a major financial services corporation, to deposit more than $1.2 million into her brokerage account when it only meant to transfer about $82 in February, nola.com reported. When the bank attempted to reclaim the money, the request was rejected because the money was not available, according to the sheriffs office. The sheriffs office said it was later learned that Spadoni had moved the funds into another account. Capt. Jason Rivarde, a sheriffs spokesman, said that although the money was put into her account, its not her money. She has no legal claim to that money, he added. Even if it was put in there by mistake. It was an accounting error. Charles Schwab & Co. sued Spadoni on Tuesday in federal court. The company tried to contact Spadoni several times to have the transferred funds returned but were unsuccessful, Rivarde said. So far, about 75% of the money has been recovered, he added. The company argued in its lawsuit that Spadonis account contract with Schwab includes an agreement that if a client receives an overpayment of funds, the client is required to return the full amount. If someone accidentally puts an extra zero on a utility payment, they would want that money returned or credited to them. This is no different, Rivarde said. He said Spadoni had been with the sheriffs office 911 center for 4 and 1/2 years."

Carl Soderberg, Wyatt Kalynuk and Dylan Strome also scored for the Blackhawks, who had dropped five of the last seven while battling Nashville and Dallas for the fourth playoff spot in the Central Division. Michael Del Zotto, Cam Atkinson and Patrik Laine had goals for Columbus, and Elvis Merzlikins made 24 saves. The Blue Jackets have lost two straight and nine of the last 11. Earlier in the day, Columbus traded one of the teams longest-tenured players, defenseman David Savard, to Tampa Bay for draft choices. The Blue Jackets started strong and then faded. Del Zotto connected on a shot from the blue line 1:03 into the game, and two minutes later Atkinson tapped in a goal off a nice feed from Jack Roslovic from the right wall to put Columbus up 2-0. We just werent ready to play, DeBrincat said. We were getting beat off the wall, missing checks. Thats pretty much what was said in the time out, just wake up a bit. I think we did a good job of scoring a few there and winning the game. DeBrincat scored on a one-timer from the right circle in the final seconds of a power play at 10:13 of the first. Then Soderberg tied it when he lifted a short shot over Merzlikins shoulder late in the first. Chicago grabbed the lead early in the second when the puck barely trickled over the goal line as Columbus Kevin Stenlund dug at it trying to clear, with rookie Kalynuk getting credit for his first NHL goal. Strome tallied late in the second. With an empty net on the other end, Laine made it 4-3 with 49 seconds left in the game but time ran out for Columbus. I dont think we played hard enough through the middle part of that game, Columbus coach John Tortorella said. Found our way in the third period. The Blue Jackets were without forward Boone Jenner and defenseman Zach Werenski because of recent injuries. Injured center Riley Nash was traded to Toronto on Friday for a seventh-round draft pick in 2022. Chicago defenseman Calvin de Haan suffered a hip pointer and did not play in the third period. I dont think its long term but well have to see how he is the next couple of days, Chicago coach Jeremy Colliton said. The 23-year-old Kalynuks first NHL goal was in question briefly while officials reviewed video to make sure the puck crossed the line. Then it withstood a review after the Blue Jackets challenged the play for goaltender interference. Obviously, not how I couldve imagined it, he said. I think even after it was reviewed, I saw it a few times and I didnt think it was even close. But the ref mustve gotten a good view of it from behind the net. Its something you dream of. I know my mom and dad and grandma Betty are smiling back home so it feels good, for sure. It wasnt pretty, but we dont care if its pretty, Colliton said. We need the points. Captain Nick Foligno was scratched and may have played his last game as a Blue Jacket. Foligno was reported to have an upper-body injury but could possibly be traded before Mondays deadline. The 33-year-old Foligno, who will be an unrestricted free agent after the season, has played 599 games for Columbus since being traded from Ottawa in 2012. The teams wrap up a two-game series Monday in Columbus. More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy"

The childrens grandmother returned home from work and found their bodies and the mother missing, Los Angeles police Lt. Raul Jovel said. The Los Angeles Police Department tweeted the children appeared to be under 5 years old. A police spokesman initially said they were under the age of 3. The gruesome discovery was made around 9:30 a.m. in the 8000 block of Reseda Boulevard, Jovel said. Police said initial reports suggested the children had been stabbed to death, but no official cause of death has been released. Jovel said investigators were still working to determine a motive. The department received reports Carrillo was driving her car and heading north on Interstate 5 when she got in an altercation in the Bakersfield area. She abandoned her car and carjacked another vehicle, Jovel said. Carrillo was detained in the Ponderosa area of Tulare County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Bakersfield, police said. At this point, she is a suspect in this incident but that doesnt exclude other people, Jovel said. Lupe Cuevas, a neighbor of Carrillo and her children, told the San Bernardino Sun that she interacted with the three children and their grandmother during afternoon walks around the neighborhood. One of the children, a girl, was drawn to her Chihuahua, Rosie, Cuevas told the newspaper. Those babies were such sweet little ones, she said. It hurts. Cuevas said she thought the girl was the middle child of the three. She wasnt shy. She was sweet. Cuevas said. An angel shouldnt have to go that way.

(AP)  A 27-year veteran of the Iowa State Patrol was shot and killed during a violent standoff with a man who fought back against agents in an armored personnel carrier and said he wanted to shoot other officers, authorities said Saturday. Sgt. Jim Smith was killed Friday night in Grundy Center as he and other officers entered the home of Michael Thomas Lang, 41, who fled there after an earlier police pursuit, authorities said. The standoff ended about midnight Friday when a team of highway patrol troopers in an armored personnel carrier smashed into the home. Lang fired multiple shots at the carrier. Three officers inside the carrier returned fire, hitting the man several times, authorities said. Lang was hospitalized in critical condition on Saturday. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held on $1 million bond. Iowa Department of Public Safety Commissioner Steve Bayens said Smith died a hero and sacrificed himself protecting others. We are hurting, we are angry, Bayens said. But rest assured were not broken. We will continue to shoulder the burdens of our communities while carrying our own. We will continue to stand in the gap of good and evil because, like Jim, that is what we are called to do. Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the division of criminal investigation, said events began at 7:22 p.m. on Friday when a Grundy Center officer tried to stop Lang for a traffic violation. Lang was known to Grundy City officers and was not supposed to be driving, he said. Lang fled but eventually stopped and assaulted the officer, Mortvedt said. During the assault, Lang yelled Shoot Me at the officer several times, and Lang disarmed the officer of his gun and stun gun and put him in a chokehold, he added. A Grundy County deputy arrived and told Lang to drop his gun. Lang instead yelled Come get me and got into his vehicle. He ended up at his home, and several law enforcement officers arrived, Mortvedt said. Langs father arrived and told officers his son had multiple weapons in the house. Four Iowa patrol troopers, including Smith, and a K-9 unit, entered the home, and Smith was shot as officers tried to clear the house, he said. Two members of the team retreated into the basement while other officers pulled Smith out. Lang barricaded himself for several hours. Officers who were in the basement said Lang made several statements about shooting Smith and expressed the desire to shoot more police officers, he said. About 11:50 p.m., a patrol team tried to enter the home in the armored personnel carrier and exchanged gunfire with Lang, Mortvedt said. No other officers were injured. Gov. Kim Reynolds said she plans to order flags flown at half-staff in Smiths memory. Its with deep sorrow that we recognize the loss of Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Jim Smith, a courageous hero who died in the line of duty, Reynolds said in a statement Saturday. Sgt. Jim Smith was a loving husband, father of two, and a pillar of the community. I along with the entire state of Iowa grieve for his family and friends as they try to cope with this devastating loss. Today we are once again reminded of the selfless sacrifices the brave men and women in uniform make. Let us never forget their bravery and that of their loved ones. Smith is the 11th trooper to die in the line of duty in the patrols history. The last death was on Sept. 20, 2011, when Trooper Mark Toney died in a crash in Warren County as he tried to make a traffic stop."

Close games, usually theyre just decided by one swing. The rulebook is more of a factor now, too, as it was last year when the pandemic-shortened season prompted some tweaks. All three of Minnesotas losses this season have come in the 10th. The game, as we are used to playing it, does change, and we have to adapt to that, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.

Taylor Trammell, whose first career homer came earlier in the game, was the inning-starting runner in the 10th. Twins reliever Taylor Rogers (0-1) picked up Braden Bishops bunt in front of the mound, but he couldnt get a clean grip and held off on a throw as a precaution. Haniger then hit a one-out fly deep enough to left for Trammell to come home. Its tough, said Rogers, the teams union rep. Its just the way its set up right now, and not much you can do about it. Kendall Graveman (1-0) worked the ninth for the victory and Keynan Middleton pitched a perfect 10th for the save, after closer Rafael Montero let the Twins tie the game without a hit in the eighth. Nelson Cruz walked, and pinch runner Jake Cave eventually scored the tying run on a wild pitch. Kyle Seagers two-out, two-strike single in the eighth inning had given the Mariners the lead they first built in the third inning when Trammell and Haniger went deep. Michael Pineda shook off the power surge and finished six innings with only two other baserunners. The Mariners were outhomered 13-3 over their first seven games. Twins starters have the best ERA in the majors at 1.88 and have yet to lose a decision. They are 5-0 in eight games. Cruz hit a two-run homer off Yusei Kikuchi, who otherwise sparkled on a 47-degree Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius) afternoon by finishing six innings for the second straight turn. With an ominous injury to James Paxton  a strained left forearm that can be a precursor to elbow reconstruction  and struggles by opening day starter Marco Gonzales, the Mariners rotation entered the game ranked 26th in baseball in ERA. The Mariners needed a lift like this from Kikuchi, their lefty with the jerky leg kick whose increased velocity this spring has helped him progress following two underwhelming seasons to start his major league career. He feels really good about where hes at, the adjustments hes made and the growth that hes made, not just with his pitches but his approach, his attitude when hes out there, manager Scott Servais said, adding: Were going to need many, many more outings like that out of him. Mariners: Paxton will get his second medical opinion on Monday, with the possibility of Tommy John surgery still looming. ... CF Kyle Lewis, the AL Rookie of the Year in 2020 who has yet to play this season because of a bone bruise on his right knee, has increased his activity and intensity, with favorable reviews of his progress, Servais said. Twins: 3B Josh Donaldson (mild right hamstring strain) moved closer to a return next week, taking groundballs and batting practice in the morning. Hell get some at-bats in simulated game situations at the alternate training site first, but hes eligible to come off the injured list on Monday. ... Players and staff received single-shot COVID-19 vaccinations on Thursday, with the club coming much closer to the desired 85% threshold than initially anticipated, Baldelli said. Mariners: RHP Chris Flexen (1-0, 0.00 ERA) pitches on Sunday. He struck out six batters in five scoreless innings in his first turn against San Francisco. Twins: RHP Matt Shoemaker (1-0, 1.50 ERA) takes the mound in the series finale. He gave up just three hits in six innings in his debut with the team on Monday at Detroit.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  Jazz Chisholm Jr. watched Jacob deGroms first 100 mph fastball whiz by and wasnt impressed. People were saying, Its an angry 100, it gets on you, the Marlins brazen, blue-haired Bahamian said. It didnt really get on me like I was expecting. Some peoples 100 is a little lighter, he added. To me, it felt like he was on the lighter side. Safe to say, Miamis youngsters dont scare easily. Chisholm hit a stunning homer off an otherwise dominant deGrom, Trevor Rogers beat the two-time Cy Young Award winner for the second time and the Marlins blanked the New York Mets 3-0 Saturday. DeGrom (0-1) matched a career best with 14 strikeouts over eight innings, the 23-year-old Rogers (1-1) fanned 10 in six and the teams combined for 28 overall. For a while, the difference was Chisholms rip in the second inning. DeGrom looked unhittable early  until the 23-year-old Chisholm barreled a 100.4 mph, 0-2 fastball thrown above the strike zone. The left-handed hitters drive reached the second deck in right field for a 1-0 lead and was estimated at 402 feet. Chisholm took a 100 mph strike to start the at-bat, then found himself swinging too quick for a 99 mph pitch. He claims he was looking for something offspeed when deGrom reached back for a third straight heater  100 above the letters. He threw me a fastball up and I just reacted to it, said Chisholm, who called deGrom the best pitcher in baseball. Got my hands above the ball, and yeah, it was a homer. It was the first 0-2 home run deGrom has allowed in the majors. He sold out for it, deGrom said. Probably should have done a better job recognizing he was going to try to get to that fastball. The next time Chisholm came up, deGrom struck him out with one fastball and then five straight changeups. Coming off their first postseason berth since 2003, the Marlins are 2-7 but with encouraging signs from a rotation featuring a 2.01 ERA in 2021. Rogers outpitched deGrom for the second time in nine major league starts. The left-hander got his first big league win against him in a 5-3 victory last Aug. 31. This was his second. Best in baseball, Jacob deGrom is, Rogers said. You really have to bring your best and then some. To see me and our whole team go out and compete with the best, it just shows you how good we are. A 2017 first-round draft pick, Rogers cruised in his third career outing against New York. He scattered three hits and two walks, retiring 11 straight in one stretch. Rogers mixed a fastball averaging 95 mph with a slider and changeup, inducing 19 swing-and-misses among his 82 pitches. He ended his outing with strikeouts of Michael Conforto and Pete Alonso, stranding two runners to preserve a 1-0 lead. This kids growing up right in front of our eyes, Mattingly said. Dylan Floro followed with a perfect seventh, Richard Bleier was helped by shortstop Miguel Rojas diving catch to rob pinch-hitter Kevin Pillar during a 1-2-3 eighth, and Yimi Garca completed the three-hitter for his first save, spelling struggling closer Anthony Bass. Chisholms homer was all Miami could muster against deGrom. The right-hander reached 14 strikeouts for the fourth time  including three times against the Marlins. He allowed a run, five hits, walked none and threw 76 of his 95 pitches for strikes. Plagued throughout his career by insufficient run support, deGrom was tagged with another disappointing loss. He even accounted for one of New Yorks three hits. Unfortunately, weve been through this before, center fielder Brandon Nimmo said. Its never easy. New York closer Edwin Daz relieved deGrom and struggled. Starling Marte hit a leadoff double and scored the next at-bat on a single by Jess Aguilar. Rojas added an RBI single before Daz was pulled and booed off the mound. Mets fans also jeered Conforto  even after he leaned into one for a walk-off hit by pitch in their home opener Thursday, a call plate umpire Ron Kulpa later admitted he missed. Conforto struck out three times to extend a slump to start what could be his final season in New York. Kulpa was cheered by fans when the umpires were announced before the game. The 32-year-old deGrom looks better than ever in his eighth major league season. Not only is he averaging 99 mph with his fastball  up from 94 mph when he debuted in 2014  hes throwing it with more rise, too. The pitch is dropping one inch less on average than it did in 2020, making it look to batters like its moving up in the strike zone as it approaches. DeGrom punched out at least 10 hitters for the 47th time, passing Dwight Gooden for second most in Mets history, trailing only Tom Seavers 60. Despite deGroms 2.06 ERA in 78 starts since the start of the 2018 season, New York is 36-42 with him on the mound. Their guy was really good on the mound, deGrom said. Mets acting general manager Zack Scott said several players have been vaccinated, but the team hasnt reached the 85% threshold set by MLB to begin easing some health and safety protocols. Marlins: C Jorge Alfaro was scratched from the lineup shortly before first pitch with tightness in his left hamstring. The issue also kept him out of Thursdays game. Chad Wallach started instead. Mets: 3B J.D. Davis was placed on the 10-day injured list shortly before first pitch with a bruised left hand. Davis was hit by a pitch Tuesday and hasnt played since. The move is retroactive to April 7. ... INF Jos Peraza was selected to the big league roster and active for the game. RHP Franklyn Kilome was designated for assignment. The teams conclude the three-game series Sunday. New York will start RHP Marcus Stroman (1-0, 1.50), who looked sharp in his season debut against Philadelphia. Miami was waiting to see how Saturdays game played out before determining a starter for Sunday.

            "content": "STOCKHOLM (AP)  The United States 16-match winning streak was snapped in a 1-1 draw with Sweden on Saturday in Carli Lloyds 300th national team appearance. Lina Hurtig put Sweden ahead off a set piece in the 38th minute before Megan Rapinoes penalty kick pulled the United States even in the 87th. The draw extended the U.S. teams unbeaten streak to 38 games. Rapinoes goal was her sixth this year to lead the team. Rapinoe said the scare from the Swedes will help the United States as it prepares for the Olympics this summer. Even throughout the whole game, I was kind of thinking, This is exactly what we need. We didnt play well. We were very sloppy. Tactically we needed to be a lot better, and just individually, she said. But those are the games where you kind of have to dig in. The Americans have not lost a match since January 2019, when they fell to France. Their 16-game winning streak was the third longest in team history. The United States now travels to Le Havre for a match against No. 3 France on Tuesday. I think that this is -- I wouldnt say one of the best things to happen to us, but something that is very good for us. In fact, thats why we came here. We came here to play good teams, we came to Europe to play opponents to get exposed to the different tactics, high-level tactics, organized teams, to try to overcome all of that, coach Vlatko Andonovski said. Lloyd wore the captains armband for her milestone game. The only other players to appear in 300 or more games for the national team are Kristine Lilly (354) and Christie Pearce Rampone (311). The Swedes shocked the Americans in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Olympics, advancing on penalties after a 1-1 draw. Sweden went on to play in the final in Rio de Janeiro but fell to Germany. Both teams have qualified for the Tokyo Games. The United States is the top-ranked team in the world. In Tokyo, the Americans will seek to become the first womens team to follow a World Cup victory with an Olympic gold medal. The Olympics will present more difficult challenges, Rapinoe said, and the United States must get better at adapting. Its going to be games where physically were not at our best because weve just played, or its really hot, or a team switches up tactics, or were just not playing well that day, Rapinoe explained. So I think individually, but really sort of collectively, we need to be able to understand whats happening in the moment very quickly and adjust. We cant just play one way all the time.

Alyson Lyons was taken to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, on Tuesday and is receiving treatment for severe road rash, gashes to her head, a fractured wrist and her legs, which were run over by a car, KRQE-TV reported Friday. Her great niece Nneka Truex said Lyons paid for a mans meal at IHOP because he couldnt cover it and offered to drive him to a truck stop in Roswell on Tuesday around 4 p.m. On the way, the man allegedly pulled a knife on Lyons, attempted to force her out of the vehicle and drove off in her Toyota Corolla, she said. New Mexico State Police launched a search for the vehicle and an officer attempted a traffic stop after identifying it on U.S. Highway 285 north of Roswell. Police said the driver  later identified as 22-year-old Mario Caballero  refused to pull over, prompting a high-speed pursuit. Police said the vehicle reached speeds of up to 120 mph (190 kph). Caballero was stopped and arrested after police deployed tire-deflation devices, the Roswell Daily Record reported. He surrendered to police without further incident. Caballero faces multiple charges including possession of stolen vehicles and aggravated fleeing law enforcement officers. He is being held at the Guadalupe County Adult Detention Center.

            "content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  The defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning acquired defenseman David Savard from the Columbus Blue Jackets in a three-team trade Saturday that also involved the Detroit Red Wings. Tampa Bay gave up a 2021 first-round pick and a 2022 third-rounder to Columbus for Savard and sent a 2021 fourth-rounder to Detroit. The Blue Jackets retained half of Savards $4.25 million salary-cap hit and the Red Wings got involved to pick up a quarter of it to help the cap-strapped Lightning. Savard, a 30-year-old pending free agent, was one of the most sought-after players ahead of the NHL trade deadline Monday. David Savard is a consummate professional, and his contributions to our organization over the past 10 years have been significant, Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen said. He has been an incredibly selfless player on the ice, a great teammate in the dressing room and a great representative of the Blue Jackets off the ice.  In his 10th season with the Blue Jackets, Savard was in the car with his family when he got the call from Kekalainen on Saturday to inform him of the trade. He knew he likely was going to be moved somewhere after being a healthy scratch for Thursday nights game against, coincidentally, the Lightning. The last 48 hours have been kind of interesting, Savard said. It was kind of a weird situation to not be in not playing and battling with your teammates, but obviously the way it turned out, Im really excited to join Tampa. Theyve had a great team for numbers of years, so Im really excited to go on a team that has a chance to win the Stanley Cup. I couldnt be more pumped to go meet the guys and join the team and be part of a run again. Savard gives the Lightning a dependable, shot-blocking right-shooting defender who is averaging just under 20 minutes a game this season. Tampa Bay general manager Julien BriseBois had said recently it was very unlikely hed be able to add before the trade deadline given his teams salary cap situation. It cost the Lightning to make that work. They also acquired minor league defenseman Brian Lashoff, who will continue to play for Detroits farm team in Grand Rapids after the trade. The Lightning are grappling with Carolina and Florida for Central Division supremacy. Savard was tied with forward Cam Atkinson for the longest-tenured player in the Blue Jackets organization. He has 166 points in 597 NHL regular-season games, all with Columbus. Weve been through a lot of battles together, and Im going to miss those guys a lot, Savard said. Theres friendships Im going to have for the rest of my life. Ive spent a lot of time here and a lot of sweat and tears we had in that locker room, so its hard to leave. But I think its that part of the business sometimes. Its just the way it happened this year that makes it kind of weird to leave. Im really excited to join Tampa. The trade is the first step in an expected revamp of a team that likely will miss the playoffs after four consecutive appearances under coach John Tortorella. Captain Nick Foligno, who has played 599 career games with the Blue Jackets, could be the next player to be moved out as the team rebuilds. The 33-year-old Foligno is a 13-year NHL veteran who also will be an unrestricted free agent. Injured center Riley Nash was dealt to Toronto for a seventh-round pick in 2022. Its the reality of the situation, Foligno said Thursday when it appeared the Savard trade was imminent. It sucks. You can lose some good friends. Its the ramifications of a (losing) season like this one. Tortorellas contract also is up after this season and neither he nor the team has commented on his future. Whyno reported from Washington.

            "content": "HOUSTON (AP)  Ramn Laureano hit a two-run homer, rookie Seth Brown connected for his first big league home run and the Oakland Athletics beat the Houston Astros 7-3 on Saturday to win the series. The Astros won the opener 6-2 on Thursday night to give them five straight victories over the As after a four-game sweep to start the season. But Oaklands offense, which sputtered as the As limped to a 1-7 start, got going on Friday night in a 6-2 win powered by three homers and kept it going in the series finale by piling up a season-high 11 hits. The As and Astros are scheduled off Sunday. Oakland manager Bob Melvin was thrilled to see his team rebound after its terrible start this year against the Astros. It was huge, Melvin said. Not only did we lose that series, every game we got blown out and thats a tough way to start the season. It was important for us to gain some confidence against them. To be able to respond after that and losing (Thursday) was big for us. There were two outs in the fifth when the As got a single from Mark Canha. Laureano followed with his drive, which bounced off the train tracks above left field, to push the lead to 4-0. The bases were loaded with two outs in the seventh when Jed Lowrie knocked a single into shallow center field to stretch Oaklands advantage to 6-0. Brown sent a homer into the second deck in the eighth inning to give the Athletics five home runs in the last two games after they managed just three in their first eight. Five of Oaklands runs on Saturday came with two outs. We are a clutch team and we know it, Laureano said. We dont shy away from it. We have a pretty good professional lineup so I feel good about it. Saturdays victory was helped by a strong start from Frankie Montas (1-1), who struggled in his debut, allowing seven runs in less than three innings of a 10-3 loss to the Dodgers. He was much better against the Astros, yielding six hits and one run in six-plus innings to snap a career-long three-game losing streak dating to September. I think it was just my location, Montas said. My last outing I wasnt really locating my fastball and today I was able to locate it to both sides of the plate. Montas held Houston scoreless and retired seven in a row before Kyle Tuckers solo homer to start the seventh ended his day. Its just two games, Tucker said. Our season is so long. were going to lose games, were going win games. Weve got to do our best to get guys on, move them over. Sergio Romo took over for Montas and plunked Aledmys Daz before he was chased by Jose Altuves RBI double with two outs. Jake Diekman took over and he was greeted with a run-scoring triple by Michael Brantley that cut the lead to 6-3. But Diekman retired Carlos Correa to limit the damage. Houston starter Jos Urquidy (0-1) allowed seven hits and four runs while striking out seven in six innings. Athletics: DH Mitch Moreland sat out a second straight game with a tight hamstring. Astros: 3B Alex Bregman was out of the lineup as he deals with what manager Dusty Baker said were sore legs. He is expected to return for the next game. ... RHP Pedro Bez was transferred from the COVID-19 injured list to the 10-day IL with a sore right shoulder. ... RHP Austin Pruitt was transferred to the 60-day injured list after having elbow surgery this offseason. Houston starter Jake Odorizzi, who had been at the teams alternate training site, was added to the taxi squad Saturday and worked out with the Astros before the game. He is expected to make his season debut Tuesday night against Detroit after getting a late start by not signing with the Astros until March 8. Athletics: Oakland has a day off on Sunday and Chris Bassitt (0-2, 5.56 ERA) will start the opener of a two-game series at Arizona on Monday. Astros: Houston is also off on Sunday before opening a three-game series with Detroit on Monday. Zack Greinke (1-0, 1.38) will start. It will be Houstons first meeting with Tigers manager A.J. Hinch since he was fired by the Astros after being suspended for a year by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred for his role in the teams sign-stealing scheme.

Ruben Roman, 21, is seen on video firing the weapon that brought police to the Little Village neighborhood on the night of March 29. He and 13-year-old Adam Toledo fled the scene together, with officers in pursuit, prosecutors said. Roman was arrested as another officer chased Toledo, who was holding a gun when the officer shot him, prosecutors said. That gun matched the spent cartridge casings that were found in the area where Roman was firing, prosecutors said. If the defendant does not bring the 13-year-old with him, if he doesnt bring his gun with him while on gun offender probation, if he doesnt shoot that gun seven to eight times on a city street with the victim standing in arms length of him while hes firing those shots  none of it would have happened, Assistant States Attorney James Murphy said in court, the Chicago Tribune reported. Romans attorney, Assistant Public Defender Courtney Smallwood, vigorously rejected the implication that Roman is responsible for Toledos death, noting that the gun was allegedly recovered from Toledo. The victim is dead at the hand of the Chicago police officers, not my client, she said, calling Toledos death tragic. Roman was ordered held on $150,000 bond on charges of child endangerment and gun possession. Lawyers for the Toledo family said they were present during the bond hearing but the statement released by the WeissOrtiz, PC firm said it was not in a position to comment. The statement added that the firm has an appointment this coming week with the Civilian Office of Police Accountability to view police body camera footage and other materials from the March 29 police shooting."

            "content": "U.S. News ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP)  Maryland lawmakers voted Saturday to override Republican Gov. Larry Hogans vetoes of three far-reaching police reform measures that supporters say are needed to increase accountability and restore public trust. One of the measures repeals job protections in the police disciplinary process that critics say impede accountability. Maryland approved the nations first Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights in 1974, and about 20 states have adopted similar laws setting due process procedure for investigating police misconduct. Maryland is the first to repeal the law, replacing it with new procedures that give civilians a role in the police disciplinary process. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly has been working on reforms for months, following nationwide protests against racial injustice that were fueled by the police custody death of George Floyd in Minnesota nearly one year ago. Last year, I attended and participated in multiple demonstrations of people demanding change  the young and the old, people of all races and walks of life, said Sen. Charles Sydnor, a Democrat who sponsored one of the measures. With so many situations being thrust before our eyes, we could no longer deny what we see, and I thank my colleagues for believing their eyes and listening to the majority of Marylanders. Opponents said the measures went too far. The package includes provisions to increase the civil liability limit on lawsuits involving police from $400,000 to $890,000. An officer convicted of causing serious injury or death through excessive force would face 10 years in prison. Sen. Robert Cassilly, a Republican, described the legislation as anti-cop. It allows for hindsight review of folks sitting in the easy chairs to judge people who made split-second decisions in volatile situations, when an officer fears for his or her life and the lives of others, Cassilly said. Hogan also vetoed legislation with a new statewide use-of-force policy and mandated use of body cameras statewide by July 2025. Another vetoed measure would expand public access to records in police disciplinary cases and limit the use of no-knock warrants. Under the bill, police could only use no-knock warrants between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., except in an emergency. In his veto message, Hogan wrote that he believed the measures would further erode police morale, community relationships, and public confidence. They will result in great damage to police recruitment and retention, posing significant risks to public safety throughout our state, Hogan wrote. But Sen. Jill Carter, a Baltimore Democrat, said erosion of public confidence occurs when nothing is done after residents file complaints against police, who are then able to exact retaliation for the complaint with full knowledge that therell be no transparency, therell be no public disclosure, and therell be no repercussions. Its a critically important step in the right direction, said Carter, who sponsored the bill to increase public access to police disciplinary records. The measure is named after Anton Black, a 19-year-old African American who died in police custody in 2018 in a rural town on Marylands Eastern Shore. Maryland has struggled with police accountability problems in recent years. Baltimores police department entered into a federal consent decree after Freddie Gray suffered a broken neck in police custody and died, sparking unrest in the city in 2015. Lawmakers approved some police reforms the following year, but critics have said they were not enough. Hogan wrote that two measures would go into effect without his signature. One of them would create a unit in the attorney generals office to investigate police-involved deaths and prohibit law enforcement from buying surplus military equipment. The other would enable Baltimore voters to decide whether the states largest city should take full control of the police department from the state. Separately on Saturday, the legislature also overrode Hogans veto of a bill that will ban sentences of life in prison without possibility of parole for juveniles."

            "content": "NORMAN, Okla. (AP)  Oklahoma has hired Drake coach Jennie Baranczyk as its next womens basketball coach. Oklahoma made the announcement in a news release on Saturday. Baranczyk replaces Sherri Coale, who retired last month after 25 years of leading the program. Baranczyk coached Drake the past nine seasons. She had a 192-96 overall record and led the Bulldogs to NCAA tournament berths in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The two-time Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year had a .667 winning percentage, fifth best in league history. Her track record of overseeing creative and effective offenses, and producing high win totals, conference championships and postseason appearances during her time at Drake certainly appealed to our search committee as it evaluated the very competitive candidate pool, Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione said in a statement. But her mastery of the head coaching role extends far beyond the court, and its clear that her personal and professional values align with ours. This season, Drake led the nation in assists per game (20.4), ranked sixth in the country in field goal percentage (48.1%), 22nd in scoring offense (76.4 ppg) and 24th in 3-point field goal percentage (36.4%). The Bulldogs finished 18-12 overall and in second place in league play with a 13-5 record. Under Baranczyk, Drake spent multiple weeks ranked in the AP Top 25 poll in 2016-17 and 2018-19 seasons. In November 2018, the Bulldogs climbed as high as No. 24 to earn the programs highest ranking since 2001.

            "content": "CLEVELAND (AP)  Aaron Civale allowed just three hits while dominating Detroit over 7 2/3 innings and was backed by five home runs, including Jordan Luplows three-run shot, as the Cleveland Indians pounded the Tigers 11-3 on Saturday night. Luplow narrowly missed a second three-run homer, settling for a two-run double to finish with a career-high five RBIs. Civale (2-0), who beat the Tigers in his season debut a week ago, continued a run of strong starting pitching for Cleveland, whose rotation has a 2.60 ERA through seven games. The right-hander gave up two singles and faced the minimum through six innings before Robbie Grossman homered in the seventh. Civale didnt issue a walk and struck out six before manager Terry Francona replaced him in the eighth after 90 pitches. He pitched really well, Francona said. He threw his breaking ball for lead strikes. He elevated his fastball. He threw a good changeup. Kind of like (Zach) Plesac last night, they had to respect three different pitches and three different speeds. Jeimer Candelario hit a two-run homer in the ninth for Detroit. Luplows 432-foot shot to straightaway center with two outs in the fourth off rookie Tarik Skubal (0-1) put the Indians ahead 6-0. Franmil Reyes hit his third homer in two days, Roberto Prez and Andrs Gimnez each added a two-run homer and Csar Hernndez had a solo shot for the Indians, who will try to complete a three-game series sweep Sunday. The Indians have homered nine times in their past three games. Theyre 4-0 when hitting more than one homer, and their 14 homers in the first seven games are the most by a Cleveland team since the 1997 Indians hit 15. After breaking down his own performance, Civale tipped his cap to Clevelands offense. One more thing, Civale said, wrapping up his Zoom session. Runs are awesome. That was fun. Skubal was tagged for three homers in four innings. What happened tonight was unacceptable, said the left-hander, who held the Indians to two runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings last week. Thats not who I am. But its just learning from it and move forward. I get the ball in another five days and I can prepare very well between now and then. Luplow appeared to hit his second three-run homer in the sixth, but the umpires ruled it hit the top of the wall in left and the call of a double was upheld following an unusually long video review. Luplow crouched at second base almost as if he was praying while the umpires conferred with replay headquarters in New York and fans watched several replays on the giant scoreboard. Francona didnt argue with plate umpire Kerwin Danley, but not because he agreed with the ruling. I told Kerwin if the game wouldve been closer they mightve had a first where somebody in New York wouldve had to throw me out, Francona joked. I thought it was a home run, too. With Detroit starting a left-hander, Luplow got the start in center because hes a .270 career hitter against lefties. In the fourth, Yu Chang doubled with one out, Prez walked, and one out later, Luplow rocketed his second homer to the deepest part of Progressive Field. Prez battled a shoulder injury all last season. And while it didnt bother him defensively (he won a Gold Glove), it impacted how he swung the bat. Prez hit just one homer in 97 at-bats in 2020. Hes already doubled that total, and after losing 25 pounds in the offseason, he feels better than he has in years. Its nice to see him playing freely and its fun to watch, Civale said. I mean, its fun to watch just as a teammate and Im sure as fans they definitely enjoy that. With San Diego finally getting its first no-hitter on Friday, the Indians now have the longest current drought between no-nos in the majors. Cleveland hasnt had one since Len Barkers perfect game in 1981. Of course, the Indians also own the longest ongoing World Series drought dating to 1948. Emmanuel Clase has been a revelation for the Indians after the reliever spent last season on the restricted list due to an 80-game drug suspension. The team knew the right-hander, who came over in 2019 from Texas in the trade involving two-time Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber, had potential. They didnt expect him to blossom this quickly. We didnt get a chance to get to know him last spring real well, Francona said. Then he was gone and he was out in Arizona. This spring, he seems like a different person. Hes really embraced being a part of our team and our organization. Boy, he loves to fill up the strike zone. Thats a good thing. His future and present is really bright. Tigers: RHP Julio Teheran will miss multiple starts with a shoulder strain. Teheran was warming up for Fridays series opener when he felt tightness in his triceps and was shut down. The 30-year-old was a non-roster invitee this spring. Michael Fulmer, the 2016 AL Rookie of the Year who underwent Tommy John surgery in 2019, will temporarily take Teherans rotation spot. Indians LHP Logan Allen (0-1) makes his second start in the series finale against Detroits Jos Urea (0-1). More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

Eastern Washington (5-1, 5-1 Big Sky Conference) has reeled off five straight wins since its Feb. 27 opener and hasnt scored fewer than 32 points during the streak. Despite the win, Eastern Washington will have to wait until April 18 to see whether theyve done enough to secure one of six at-large bids to the FCS playoffs.

Just got my COVID-19 vaccine at the @NHMS, Sununu tweeted. A big THANK YOU to all of the incredible volunteers, state employees, and staff who make the process so seamless! Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette and Bureau of Infectious Disease Control Chief Beth Daly also received their vaccines. Thousands of New Hampshire residents have been vaccinated at the site. Also, the University of New Hampshire womens soccer team has pulled out of the America East tournament in accordance with COVID-19 protocols within the program, the school said Saturday. The Wildcats (5-2, 2-2 America East) had qualified for the four-team tournament as the second-place finisher in Division A. No additional information was released. The College of the Holy Cross has restricted all in-person activities, including varsity sports, until at least Wednesday in response to dozens of new COVID-19 cases on campus. Contact tracing shows that of at least 40 new cases, most are linked to outdoor gatherings of students during warmer weather and Easter break travel, the Jesuit school in Worcester said Friday. Classes will be held remotely, the library is closed, and Sunday Mass will be livestreamed. Students who live off campus will not be allowed on, except for coronavirus testing and visits to health services, or to pick up food from the dining hall. Students who violate the restrictions face serious consequences, the school said. Weve noticed more close contacts converting to positive cases than earlier in the year. More students who test positive are also reporting more serious symptoms than in the past, the school said. The college, with about 3,000 students, will reevaluate restrictions Wednesday. Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine says wearing masks, physically distancing and staying out of crowded spaces are more important than ever now with rising cases and the presence of virus variants in the state. In addition to the variants which are more easily transmissible, the increase is driven by a willingness by some to take more risk and by pandemic fatigue, Levine said Friday during the governors virus briefing. This pandemic is not yet over, Levine said. We cant let the virus spread faster than we can get Vermonters vaccinated. High coronavirus case counts and outbreaks are likely to continue in the very near future with the presence of virus variants in the state, affecting those who are not fully vaccinated, he said. The state is finding the strain first detected in the United Kingdom much more frequently now, he said. The state has also detected the variant first found California, and the strain first detected in Brazil was recently detected in a New Hampshire resident who was being tested in Vermont, Levine said. The Vermont Department of Health on Saturday reported 133 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but no additional virus-related fatalities. There have now been almost 21,000 confirmed cases on the state, while deaths stayed steady at 231. The number of people in the states hospitals with the disease rose slightly to 25, of whom eight were in intensive care. More than 300 new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Maine, but there have been no additional deaths caused by the disease, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. It was the fourth consecutive day of new case counts over 300, many of them in people under 30, the agency said. The seven-day average of new daily cases was almost 334 on Saturday. Al Fresco on the Hill is returning to Providence. The program to allow struggling restaurants on Federal Hill to set up up tables on the street in a safe manner is scheduled to start May 14 and run for about 20 weeks through early October, Mayor Jorge Elorza said Friday. Under the program, a portion of Atwells Avenue will close to motor vehicles on Fridays and Saturdays from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Rick Simone of the Federal Hill Commerce Association said about 25 restaurants are planning on participating, but he expects that number to grow."

(AP)  A sixth person has died following a shooting earlier this week at the hands of a former NFL player who also killed four members of a South Carolina family, local officials said Saturday. Robert Shook, 38, an air conditioning technician from Cherryville, North Carolina, has died from injuries sustained in the Wednesday shooting while he was working at the home, according to York County Coroner Sabrina Gast. Authorities say Phillip Adams killed Rock Hill physician Robert Lesslie; his wife, Barbara; two of their grandchildren, 9-year-old Adah Lesslie and 5-year-old Noah Lesslie; and another air conditioning technician, James Lewis, who had been working with Shook at the Lesslie home. Adams later shot himself to death. His brain is now being examined for possible degenerative disease that has been shown to cause violent mood swings and other cognitive disorders in some athletes and members of the military. Adams, 32, played in 78 NFL games over six seasons for six teams. He joined the 49ers in 2010 as a seventh-round draft pick out of South Carolina State, and though he rarely started, he went on to play for New England, Seattle, Oakland and the New York Jets before finishing his career with the Atlanta Falcons in 2015. As a rookie, Adams suffered a severe ankle injury and never played for the 49ers again. Later, with the Raiders, he had two concussions over three games in 2012. Whether he suffered long-lasting concussion-related injuries wasnt immediately clear. Adams would not have been eligible for testing as part of a broad settlement between the league and former players over such injuries, because he hadnt retired by 2014.

The Raptors, who built an 84-46 lead late in the second quarter, were without their top three scorers in Pascal Siakam (rest), Fred VanVleet (left hip flexor strain) and Kyle Lowry (right foot infection), who are averaging a combined 57.5 points. Toronto rookie Malachi Flynn had season highs of 20 points and 11 assists in his second NBA start, while OG Anunoby scored 15 points and Yuta Watanabe added 14 off the bench. Trent also matched his career best with seven rebounds. Gary doesnt need a whole lot of encouragement to keep shooting, which you can probably tell, Raptors coach Nick Nurse said with a chuckle. And he was feeling it, too. It was one of those nights, right? Collin Sexton scored 29 points, Darius Garland had 19 points and eight assists, and Isaiah Hartenstein posted 12 points, eight boards and six assists for Cleveland, which trailed 47-26 after the first quarter and 87-54 at halftime. It was embarrassing what happened in the first half, Sexton said. We came out being soft and its our job as starters to be better, to set the tone for the game right away. Toronto made its first 12 shots and broke the Cavaliers opponent records for points in the first quarter and in any half. Trent buried his first nine attempts and had 25 points at the break, six shy of his previous best for an entire game. Gary caught fire super early and it never left, Flynn said. He didnt force anything at all. He just kept looking for his shot when it was there. The Raptors wrap up a stretch of nine games in 15 days Sunday at New York. Nurse said Siakam will play and Lowry could return against the Knicks. Raptors: VanVleet sat out his fourth straight game and Lowry missed his seventh in a row. Toronto last played with its starting backcourt on March 29 at Detroit. ... G Jalen Harris (right hip pointer) and G Paul Watson Jr. (COVID-19 protocols) also were inactive. ... C Khem Birch, who played for Nurse on the Canadian national team in 2019, was signed before the game and will join the team in New York. Cavaliers: C Jarrett Allen (concussion), F Larry Nance Jr. (illness) and G Dylan Windler (left knee soreness) remain out, but coach J.B. Bickerstaff said each is making progress. Allen has missed seven games since absorbing an elbow to the head on March 26 at the Lakers. ... F Mfiondu Kabengele signed a 10-day contract. The 6-foot-9, 250-pounder averaged 1.2 points in 23 games with the Clippers this season. Cavaliers C Kevin Love, who remains on a minutes restriction, scored 18 points in his fifth game back from a three-month absence with a strained right calf. The three-time All-Star is averaging 13.6 points and 7.2 rebounds over 22.8 minutes since returning. Kevin takes so much pressure off everyone else because teams have to game plan for him, Bickerstaff said. Hes such an efficient player. Raptors: Visit New York on Sunday. Toronto has won its last four games at Madison Square Garden and has beaten the Knicks nine straight times overall. Cavaliers: Host New Orleans on Sunday. Cleveland has lost five in a row to the Pelicans, including a 116-82 road drubbing in their only meeting last season. More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

Martinez underwent coronavirus testing and the team is awaiting the results. Going on the COVID-19 IL does not require a positive test. If he tests negative twice, Martinez can return to the lineup for the series finale Sunday at Baltimore. We feel pretty confident that hell be able to be with us (Sunday), but obviously we have to wait, Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. Martinez has been of the hottest hitters in MLB to start the season. He is batting .433 (13 for 30) with seven doubles, two home runs and 12 RBIs. Martinez entered the day leading all major league players in extra-base hits with nine. He has also recorded at least one extra-base hit in all of his teams first seven games of the year, making him one of five players in MLB history to accomplish that feat. Cora fully understands the leagues precaution with Martinez. Ill tell you my story in spring training, Cora said. We got this app that they asked you how you feel, right? I had allergies in spring training, and you got to be honest, you know, as far as like, OK, so I felt this. And as soon as I sent it, I got a text, a phone call and a lot of people panic and in less than five minutes. So I had to go to JetBlue Park, do the rapid test, stay in my office until they gave me the green light and that was it. But its understandable, right? We know what we are fighting against. But we dont know how it moves or when we can get it, where, but I understand the protocols. Im OK with it. So if we dont have J.D. for one day, so be it, you know? Somebody has to step up and do the job tonight. Teams can carry up to five players on a taxi squad on the road in case of a coronavirus outbreak. The Red Sox recalled Michael Chavis from the alternate training site to fill the opening on the 26-man roster. Chavis hit .250 (15 for 60) with three doubles, six home runs, 11 RBIs and a .892 OPS over 25 preseason games this spring. More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

            "content": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)  The Florida Panthers addressed losing Aaron Ekblad to a season-ending injury by acquiring defenseman Brandon Montour in a trade with the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday. For Buffalo, the last-place Sabres continued selling off assets by acquiring a third-round draft pick in what is not expected to be their final move before the NHLs trade deadline on Monday. The Sabres traded veteran Eric Staal to Montreal last month, and are in negotiations to trade forward Taylor Hall, who is completing a one-year, $8 million contract. At 9-25-6, Buffalo is all but mathematically out of contention, and in position to match the NHL playoff drought record of 10 seasons. Montour is a pending unrestricted free-agent completing a one-year, $3.85 million contract. The Panthers add a two-way defenseman to a lineup that lost its top blueliner in Ekblad, who will miss 12 weeks after having surgery on March 30 to repair a broken left leg. Brings some puck-moving ability on the back end, coach Joel Quenneville said of Montour. Hes mobile, could get some power-play time. The trade was announced as Florida took the ice to play at Dallas and with the Panthers in a tight race for first place in the Central Division standings. Florida fell from first place to a tie with Tampa Bay for second after back-to-back losses to Carolina this week. Brandon is a capable and talented right-shot defenseman who will have an immediate impact on our club, Panthers GM Bill Zito said in a statement released by the team. His two-way acumen and ability to play important minutes make him an exciting addition to the Panthers. The Panthers opened salary cap space on Thursday in a trade that sent forward Brett Connolly and defenseman Riley Stillman to Chicago for forward Lucas Wallmark and defenseman Lucas Carlsson. Montour, who turns 27 on Sunday, is in his fifth NHL season and has been with Buffalo since the Sabres acquired him from Anaheim on Feb. 24, 2019. He has five goals  four coming in his last seven games  and 14 points in 38 games this season. Overall, the 2014 second-round draft pick has 29 goals and 76 assists for 105 points in 281 career games. Hes a very skilled defenseman, Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov said after a 4-1 loss to the Stars. He can help us with the puck and the offensive game, holds the puck really well. Good addition and looking forward to seeing him soon. Sabres interim coach Don Granato praised Montour for not allowing trade discussions to affect his performance over the past few weeks. Through this, Brandon was incredible. He played hard last night. He kept this out of his mind when the puck dropped, said Granato, referring to the Sabres 4-3 loss to Washington on Friday. He was a lot of fun to be around. Hes competitive. Brings a lot of energy, a lot of life, Granato added. Of course, you dont like losing guys like that, but we all understand and its part of our game. NOTES: Granato said barring a setback, rookie center Dylan Cozens is scheduled to return for Buffalos game at Philadelphia on Sunday. Cozens has missed six games with an upper body injury. ... Granato said D Will Borgen isnt expected to resume practicing until Buffalo returns from its three-game road trip, which ends at Washington on Thursday. Borgen has missed 26 games with a broken forearm. AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno and freelance reporter Jeff Miller contributed.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Austin and Lorenzana discussed the situation in the South China Sea and the recent massing of Chinese vessels at Whitsun Reef, which has drawn criticism from Manila. China has said its vessels are there for fishing. In their phone call, Austin proposed to Lorenzana several measures to deepen defense cooperation, including by enhancing situational awareness of threats in the South China Sea, Kirby said. He did not elaborate. Kirby said earlier this week that the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group, as well as the amphibious ship USS Makin Island, are operating in the South China Sea. The U.S. has no military forces based permanently in the Philippines but sometimes rotates forces to the country under the U.S.-Philippines Visiting Forces Agreement. The recent gathering of Chinese vessels near the Philippines is among moves the United States has criticized as efforts by Beijing to intimidate smaller nations in the region."

The Daily Progress reports that a prerecorded dedication ceremony aired Saturday for the University of Virginias Memorial to Enslaved Laborers, which was finished in 2020. The memorial commemorates more than 4,000 enslaved and free laborers who built and worked at the university in Charlottesville, Virginia. University President Jim Ryan said the memorial is an especially meaningful symbol of healing and connection after a year marked by the pandemic as well as unprecedented challenges to democracy and the unjust deaths of black citizens at the hands of law enforcement. It is not only a bridge between generations, but also a bridge from the darkness of hidden injustices to the light that knowledge and recognition brings, Ryan said. Students led the initial push for a memorial more than a decade ago. Ishraga Eltahir, founding chair of the Memorial for Enslaved Laborers student committee, said they pushed for a truthful telling of a painful but critical part of the universitys history. Most importantly, we came together to acknowledge the very real lives of those honored women and men often erased from common narrative, she said. It took several generations of stakeholders, fighting to make the case for public recognition."

Joel LEsperance joined Robertson scoring in the first two minutes and Anton Khudobin made 20 saves for the Stars, who won for the fourth time in their last six games as the reigning Western Conference champions went into play seven points out of a playoff spot in the Central Division. We needed a team effort, Dallas coach Rick Bowness said. We needed everyone to contribute. Weve got to find a way to keep it going here, said Benn, the Stars captain. Roope Hintz and Joe Pavelski had two assists each. Robertsons 11 goals tie him for second place among NHL rookies, and seven have come in the last 10 games. Aleksander Barkov scored a power-play goal with 1.5 seconds to play in the second period for the Panthers, who lost their third straight game to match a season high. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 16 shots in a rare loss to the Stars  he has a career record of 15-2-1 against Dallas. It was one of those games, garbage-can game for me, first one of the year, Panthers coach Joel Quenneville said. Robertson scored on a top-shelf wrist shot one minute in. Forty-nine seconds later, LEsperance tipped a centering pass from Justin Dowling on the rush. Benn settled a Pavelski pass from behind the net off his right skate in front of the net to give the Stars a 3-0 lead at 9:03 of the first period. Barkov stuffed in his own rebound amid a scrum around the Dallas crease for his 17th goal of the season, tying him for the team lead. Robertson answered 1:21 into the third period with an unassisted goal in transition through traffic that sailed past Bobrovskys glove. Robertson has gone from spending five of the first seven Dallas games this season in the minors to working on the Stars top line with Hintz and Pavelski in recent weeks. Hes become one of the teams top producers and has put himself in the conversation for the Calder Trophy as the NHLs top rookie. All I wanted to be is an impact player on this team, Robertson said. Thats something Ive worked to do these last couple months, and I want to continue doing along the stretch. Hes done a great job, taking advantage of the opportunity, Benn said. Fits in well with Roope and Pav and definitely great to see. After acquiring two players from Chicago on Thursday, the Panthers traded for Buffalo defenseman Brandon Montour on Saturday in exchange for their 2021 third-round draft choice. The seventh-year player had five goals and nine assists in 38 games this season with the Sabres. Brings some puck-moving ability on the back end, Quenneville said. Hes mobile. Could get some power-play time. Hes always wanted to be up on the play and help the forwards to create some more scoring chances, defenseman Radko Gudas said. Im looking forward to meeting him. Dallas is 13-1-2 when leading after two, its only loss on Feb. 25 at Florida when a 2-0 lead midway through the third period ended in a 3-2 loss.  Khudobin has earned points in each of his last five games (3-0-2).  Hintz, in and out of the lineup much of this season with a lower-body injury, has 30 points in 28 games.  Barkovs goal snapped an 0-for-13 Florida power-play drought in five games and likewise was the first against Dallas penalty kill in six games after 13 straight kills.  Dowlings assist was his first point since Feb. 25. Panthers: Finish the two-game series at Dallas on Tuesday night. Stars: Complete a back-to-back on Sunday night at Nashville. Theyre 1-3-3 in back-to-back finales. More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

            "content": "U.S. Supreme Court NEW YORK (AP)  Ramsey Clark, the attorney general in the Johnson administration who became an outspoken activist for unpopular causes and a harsh critic of U.S. policy, has died. He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets including The New York Times and The Washington Post. After serving in President Lyndon Johnsons Cabinet in 1967 and 68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death very, very sad in a season of losses. The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman, Kuby said. Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights. In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. If you dont insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others? he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedys Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever  Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Trumans attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called the noblest quest of the American people in our time. He also maintained opposition to the death penalty and wiretapping, defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnsons attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. We won the case, that was the worst part, he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. Moneys not an interest of mine, he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clarks client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers. There were usually two to three dozen active cases on Clarks legal calendar, and about 100 more in the background. Capital punishment cases were a staple. We talk about civil liberties, he said. We have the largest prison population per capita on Earth. The worlds greatest jailer is the freest country on Earth?"

            "content": "After injuries to their top two goaltenders derailed the Colorado Avalanche in the playoffs last year, theyre loading up on depth in net in hopes of making a deep run this season. Colorado acquired veteran goaltender Devan Dubynk from the San Jose Sharks on Saturday in exchange for defenseman Greg Pateryn and a fifth-round pick in the 2021 draft. Dubnyk and March trade pickup Jonas Johansson give the NHL-leading Avalanche some insurance in net behind starter Philipp Grubauer, with their sights set on the Stanley Cup. We saw last year how important goalie depth is in the playoffs, coach Jared Bednar said. To be able to acquire the two guys that weve acquired here recently, I think it just makes our team deeper and stronger. Dubnyk, 34, has 26 games of Stanley Cup playoff experience during his career, all with Minnesota. This season, he has a 3.18 goals-against average and .898 save percentage for struggling San Jose. Devan brought the element of consummate professionalism and class to our dressing room in what has been an extremely unique and challenging season, Sharks general manager Doug Wilson said. He fit seamlessly within our group and helped mentor many of our younger players. We thank him for his contributions to our club on and off the ice this season and wish him the best in Colorado. Dubnyk and Pateryn are set to become free agents after this season. Colorado acquired Pateryn earlier this season in a salary-shedding deal that sent defenseman Ian Cole to Minnesota. The Avalanche have made two trades in two days after acquiring defenseman Patrik Nemeth from Detroit for a fourth-round pick on Friday. Nemeth spent two seasons with Colorado from 2017-19 and provides some defensive experience with Erik Johnson injured and expected to miss the rest of the regular season. To have that defender is super important, said captain Gabriel Landeskog, who played youth hockey with Nemeth back home in Sweden. Hes going to be big for us. Hes always good at blocking shots and great on the (penalty kill), so hell be well-received back in the locker room. The Avalanches 58 points through 40 games are the most in the league and have them four up on Vegas for first place in the West Division. Grubauer has been at the center of that success. He leads the league with 24 victories and has a 1.87 GAA and .922 save percentage in 33 games but has never played in more than 37 games during a regular season in his NHL career. We know that we want to give Grubi some rest, Bednar said. For the stretch run and heading into the playoffs, we want to make sure hes rested and healthy. Hes obviously our No. 1, and the goalie depth is real important. Colorado GM Joe Sakic may not be done dealing. With Johnson and goalie Pavel Francouz on long-term injured reserve and even without San Jose retaining any of Dubnyks salary, the Avalanche have $4.4 million more in space to use before the deadline Monday afternoon. I think its important that our guys see that the organization is supporting them, Bednar said. We recognize that the guys have had a real good year here. Were in a real good spot for the stretch run, and if we can make some adds that will help us long term, whether big or small, were open to doing that.

(AP)  Jaden Johnson threw for a pair of touchdowns and Celdon Manning ran for 99 yards and Missouri State beat Youngstown State 21-10 Saturday to earn at least a share of the Missouri Valley Football Conference title. For the FCS 15th-ranked Bears (5-4, 5-1), the win marks the first conference title since 1990. The Bears put together a 5-1 spring record and now will await to see if they earned their way into the 16-team playoff. First-year coach Bobby Petrino inherited team that went 1-10 in 2019 and established 21 losing seasons since the Idaho Vandals beat the Bears in the 1990 playoffs. Petrino was the head offensive coach for that Vandals team. On Saturday, after the Penguins took a 3-0 lead on Colten McFaddens 38-yard field goal with 8:21 before halftime, Jeremiah Wilson ran it from 2-yards out to give the Bears the lead for good after a 15-play, 85-yard drive that took six-and-a-half minutes to complete. Missouri State took control in the third when Johnson connected on scoring passes of 8 and 31 yards to Damoriea Vick for a 21-3 advantage. The Penguins (1-6, 1-6) closed the games scoring when Joe Craycraft threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Dra Rusthon with 8:40 left. Craycraft threw for 100 yards and Jaleel McLaughlin ran for 100 yards on 20 carries for Youngstown State. More AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball"

            "content": "Emergent BioSolutions, the troubled manufacturer at the heart of Johnson & Johnsons coronavirus vaccine production problems, gave its chief executive officer a 51 percent increase in total compensation in 2020, to $5.6 million, according to a public filing Friday. The annual proxy disclosure by the publicly traded company said CEO Robert Kramer received $893,000 in salary, a $1.2 million bonus, $2.1 million in stock awards, and $1.4 million in stock options. The company said in its filing for investors that Emergents response to the pandemic last year played a role in Kramers bonus, citing the expansion of its contract manufacturing business and other advances, including a successful bond offering. It had a 41 percent increase in revenue in 2020. Kramer rose to the top job at the company in 2019 after serving in a number of other high-level executive jobs there since 2012. Emergent did not respond to a request for comment Saturday. As a federal contractor specializing in biodefense and emergency response, Emergents 2020 financial success was fueled in large part by a burst of federal spending to fight the coronavirus pandemic. It received $628 million in a federal contract to upgrade and reserve cacpacity. It also signed vaccine manufacturing agreements with Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca at its Baltimore manufacturing facility as those companies raced to develop and produce vaccines to fulfill government orders. But manufacturing problems at Emergent became public on March 31 after Emergent ruined a large volume of Johnson & Johnsons raw vaccine substance  representing up to 15 million doses. Federal officials said it was contaminated with ingredients from the AstraZeneca vaccine. The problems prompted the federal government to remove all production of AstraZenecas product, which has not been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, from the plant. Johnson & Johnson also took direct control of manufacturing of its vaccine there. The mishaps have compounded delays in the FDAs certification of the plant for Johnson & Johnson vaccine production. Until that certification is granted, raw vaccine substance made there cannot be released to the public, forcing Johnson & Johnson to rely on a trickle of imports from a production plant in the Netherlands. The government has slashed the amount of vaccine allocated to states from Johnson & Johnson and the company has backed off its previous pledge to deliver 24 million doses of vaccines to the federal government in April. Emergents stock price reached a high this year of $125 in February; on Friday it closed at $77.40. The cascade of negative events occurred after Kramer received his 2020 compensation. But government officials had documented some warning signs at Emergent as he was earning those benefits last year. An April 2020 FDA inspection report at the plant documented concerns, The Washington Post reported this month. Some employees had not been properly trained, records were not adequately secured, and established testing procedures were not being followed. Additionally, a measure intended to prevent contamination or mix-ups was found to be deficient. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a federal official had warned in June 2020 that Emergent would have to be closely monitored in its vaccine work because of concerns about operations there, including insufficient staffing levels and training gaps. Emergent has not publicly discussed the nature of problems at its plant in any detail. It told The Post on April 1 that since the negative FDA findings in April 2020, it hosted two subsequent FDA visits that included \"reviews of the progress on the items cited in past FDA visits. In response to the manufacturing problems, Emergent has received another $23 million from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to purchase more vaccine manufacturing equipment that will allow for the potential expansion of Johnson & Johnson operations. Emergent has said it is working with the government and AstraZeneca to \"on a mutually agreed ramp-down of manufacturing for AstraZenecas COVID-19 vaccine bulk drug substance.'' Emergents top priority continues to be the strengthening of the supply chain for Johnson & Johnsons vitally needed COVID-19 vaccine, Kramer said in an April 4 company press release. We have been working closely with Johnson & Johnson and welcome the additional oversight and support at our Bayview facility.''

Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.), a veteran who lost his right eye in Afghanistan in 2012, underwent emergency surgery this week on his remaining eye, leaving him effectively blind for about a month, he said in a statement Saturday. Crenshaw said he began noticing unusual dark, blurry spots in his vision a few days ago and visited an ophthalmologist on Thursday, who discovered his left retina was detaching. He described the prognosis as obviously very bad but one that had been a lingering risk after the injuries he sustained in an IED explosion, which permanently damaged his right eye and left his left eye with a cataract, excessive tissue damage and extensive damage to the retina. This is a terrifying prognosis for someone with one eye, and the nature of the injuries that I sustained in Afghanistan, he tweeted. Anyone who knows the history of my injuries knows that I dont have a good eye, but half a good eye.  It was always a possibility that the effects of the damage to my retina would resurface, and it appears that is exactly what has happened. Crenshaw said his wife drove him Friday to undergo emergency surgery, where doctors placed a gas bubble in his remaining eye to act as a bandage for his retina. The surgery will require him to lie facedown for the next week or so, he added. The surgery went well, but I will be effectively blind for about a month, Crenshaw said. This is why youre not going to hear from me for a while. I likely will not be conducting interviews and likely will not be posting on social media, except to give updates on my health and recovery. Crenshaws congressional offices in Washington and Houston will continue to operate as they have, he said. A former Navy SEAL, Crenshaw was elected to Congress in 2018. He typically wears a dark eye patch to cover his false eye, which Saturday Night Live's Pete Davidson once mocked when Crenshaw was still a congressional candidate. The bit drew bipartisan condemnation and Davidson later apologized. On his former campaign website, Crenshaw described the recovery of his vision in his left eye as a medical miracle and said doctors originally told him he would never see again.

            "content": "States have delayed ordering hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses available to them even as coronavirus outbreaks escalate  a sign the nation is moving past its supply pinch and now faces more acute challenges related to demand, staffing and inoculation of hard-to-reach populations. The question that defined the early weeks of the vaccine rollout was why states were taking so long to administer the doses they got from the federal government. Four months into the effort, whats most mystifying is the number of states waiting to order all the doses theyve been allotted, based on their adult populations and the supplies available that week. When Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) last week asked White House officials if they would consider sending more vaccine doses to her state during a deadly surge, the state appeared not to have ordered 360,000 doses then available  a single-day snapshot that nonetheless puzzled federal officials who advised her to work with experts to make sure Michigans supply was being deployed effectively. Michigans chief medical executive, Joneigh Khaldun, said late Fridaythe doses were almost all quickly drawn down, as state officials explained to the White House, noting the federal government had deposited a large number of doses in the states account in anticipation of their later use at a mass vaccination site. She said other doses were being preserved to address a mix-up of first and second doses by some providers. Michigan wasnt the only state leaving doses on warehouse shelves. At one point last week, 13 states had more than 100,000 doses apiece available and not ordered, according to a federal official familiar with the figures who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matters sensitivity. Indiana had only pulled down 90 percent of doses available to the state, leaving 306,000 on the shelves. Texas had ordered 95 percent of its share, leaving 673,000 doses temporarily untouched. The delayshave gained notice inside the federal government, where officials have discussed whether performance metrics, including how quickly states are ordering and using their vaccine doses, and gettingthem to vulnerable groups, should be part of allocation decisions, according to three people familiar with the issue. Any new approach, however, would need sign-off from the White House, which has been at pains to avoid the appearance of penalizing some states while boosting others, including by directing additional doses to virus hot spots. The fair and equitable way to distribute the vaccine is based on the adult population by state, tribe and territory, Jeff Zients, coordinator of the White Houses coronavirus task force, said during a Friday briefing. Thats how its been done. And we will continue to do so. The virus is unpredictable. We dont know where the next increase in cases could occur. Experts argue that four months into the immunization campaign, and with more transmissible variants of the virus spreading throughout the country, states should no longer be encountering bottlenecks preventing them from making use of their full vaccine allotments. States and their health-care providers need to have the capacity at this point to deliver the vaccine doses available to them each week, said Jason L. Schwartz, an assistant professor of health policy at Yale University and a member of Connecticuts vaccine advisory committee. We shouldnt be leaving vaccine doses on the table during this time. State and county officials offered different explanations fornot ordering theirfull allocations each week. Many cited the difficulty of matching first and second doses. Others pointed to reduced demand, staffing challenges and inadequate communication between state and local officials. Mouhanad Hammami, director of the Wayne County Health Department in Michigan, said a sharp and unexplained drop-off in the countys share of Moderna doses meant it couldnt operate one of its clinics, ordinarily capable of administering 2,000 doses per day to people in the Detroit area. Sarah Verschoor, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Health, said doses not ordered had been earmarked for businesses, higher education and local health department clinics that are set to start vaccinating in the coming days. Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said last week that the states balance would be gone by last Friday, by which time orders for second doses would be placed. But 145,000 doses remained at weeks end. In North Carolina, which ended last week with 426,000 doses not ordered, state health officials initially did not respond to requests for comment. All state residents 16 and older became eligible for the shots on Wednesday. Lisa Macon Harrison, health director for Granville Vance Public Health in the northern part of the state, said orders dipped last week because of spring break. This past week was spring break for a lot of communities, and teachers and students and nurses alike had a little break planned, she said. In some places, school nurses were not available [to administer shots], and staffing levels across the nation were going to look a little different. In an emailed statement after this story was published, North Carolinas health secretary, Mandy Cohen, said the state saved some doses for the following week so that we could activate new vaccine providers and so that those doses wouldnt arrive on Good Friday. Michael Fraser, chief executive of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said some states not ordering their full allocations are experiencing soft demand and are developing new strategies to boost interest in the shots. He argued it was too soon to redistribute doses among states. But ordering delays related to second doses could propelcalls for the United States to delay booster shots, as Britain and Israel have done, to ease logistical challenges and give more people some protection. Uncertainties about how much protection first doses offer and how quickly that benefit is conferred alsogo to the heart of the intensifying debate over whether the federal government should surge vaccine to hot spots. Some argue immunity would not kick in fast enough to help contain the outbreaks, making mitigation strategies a better bet. The downside is if the surge is happening now, we know that even with a single dose of Johnson & Johnson, immunity doesnt really kick in for two to four weeks, while for Pfizer and Moderna, youre looking at more of a five- to six-week timeline, said Anuj Mehta, a Denver pulmonologist who chaired Colorados advisory group on vaccine prioritization. And thats not going to do anything to help the surge. B. Keith English, chair of Michigan State Universitys Department of Pediatrics and Human Development, disagreed about that time lag, pointing to a big falloff in symptomatic cases a couple weeks after the first dose. Just as important as surplus doses, he said, is the efficient allocation of doses the state already has available. Where rapid vaccination may be most beneficial is in areas adjacent to outbreaks, such as Washington state, where officials are closely watching a record-breaking surge in British Columbia, even though the U.S.-Canada border remains closed to nonessential travel. Umair Shah, the state health secretary, said Washington state is not yet receiving sufficient supply to target particular areas of the state and such an approach might undermine the ongoing effort to inoculate more of the elderly population. The path of the virus is unpredictable, he said, and a population-based approach is still fairest nationwide as well as within states. Pressure on the federal government to rethink its strategy has mounted as access to immunization expands nationwide but new infections areconcentrated in just a handful of states, including Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania. Michigans seven-day average of new infections rose from 1,503 on March 7 to 7,609 Friday, according to data analyzed by The Washington Post. The White Houses response to Whitmer last weekwas echoed Thursday by President Biden, who told her in a call that the federal government stood ready to dispatch additional vaccinators to her state to help make use of its supply, according to an administration official with knowledge of the conversation. As for the recommendation to move around vaccine within the state, Whitmer told reporters Friday, We have done some of that. The problem is when you look at the map, the whole state is a hot spot. Early on, officials had considered but not pursued local spread/prevalence of covid-19 as a factor in vaccine allocations, according to a memo distributed last year by the National Association of County and City Health Officials and confirmed by a federal health official involved in the deliberations. Some senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials were doubtful of a strict pro rata approach from the start, according to two officials, with one saying the formula shortchanged large urban areas where people flock for health care even if they live elsewhere. Federal officials believe one of the reasons states are leaving vaccine on the shelves is their reluctance to order shots they cant immediately put into arms, either because of limited capacity to administer them or flagging demand. Sending out doses that arent quickly administered would push states down in closely watched rankings of vaccination efficiency  which have not been used to determine allocations but nonetheless matter to state officials, who have griped to federal counterparts about the public backlash from the numbers, according to people familiar with the discussions. Kansas Health Secretary Lee Norman said his state has ordered all of its doses but that some of his counterparts discussed not doing so during a recent call among state health officers. Days before leaving office in January, Trump administration officials had unveiled an incentive system that would have rewarded states with additional shots if they quickly used their supply. The Biden administration scrapped that approach and instead retained a population-based formula, even as it gradually directed more vaccine doses to retail pharmacies, community health centers and federally run mass vaccination sites. These locations are selected in part because theyre likely to serve communities of color that are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, administration officials say. Enlarged allotments to pharmacies are alsopolitically fraught becausetheyre seen as reducing the share of doses made available to governors, who have touted increased allocations to constituents. However, doses directed to pharmacies generallyhave been administered more efficiently. Zients told governors on a recent call that states had on average administered about 80 percent of the doses sent to them, while pharmacies were performing slightly better, at 84 percent, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by The Post. There was wide variation among states, Zients said, with the top 10 states averaging about 90 percent and the bottom 10 administering about 71 percent of the doses delivered to them.

            "content": "Two South Korean industrial giants have reached a last-minute global settlement that will allow a pair of new plants in Commerce, Ga., to move ahead with plans to supply batteries for Ford and Volkswagen electric vehicles, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The deal will be a victory for President Biden, who has been eager to create jobs, build a U.S.-based supply chain for electric vehicles and move toward slowing climate change  all without taking sides in a dispute between the firms over intellectual property. SK Innovationcan now complete construction of its $2.6 billion manufacturing facilities, which will employ 1,000 workers by the end of this year. By 2024, the plants will have 2,600 workers and annually churn out lithium ion batteries for more than 300,000 electric vehicles, mostly for Ford and VW brands. The settlement will cover not only a ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission but also litigation in federal court. LG Energy Solution had accused SK of stealing trade secrets and destroying documents. In April 2019, it sought to limit SKs battery output in the United States and said the country had no battery shortage. Lawyers for both companies declined to comment Saturday. The trade commission sided with LG and restricted SKs ability to operate its plants in the United States. SK would have been barred from importing crucial battery components for 10 years. Butthe company still could have imported enough to supply batteries to certain VW brands for two years and for certain Ford brands for four years, including Fords best-selling F-150 pickup truck. During that period, VW and Ford were supposed to line up new suppliers. The Biden administration, which had until Sunday to overturn the ITC ruling, feared that finding new suppliers could prove difficult if the automobile industry rushes to expand its offerings of electric vehicles. The administration has cited the need to overhaul American car and truck fleets and make them all electric. The settlement gives the president a boost on the jobs front and among climate activists and those worried about climate change. The likelihood of Biden reversing the ITC ruling pressured LG to reduce its settlement demands, according to a person familiar with the talks, who spoke Saturday on the condition of anonymity to protect business relations. The U.S. trade representative and top South Korean government officials also got involved in the negotiations. The SK battery plants, located 70 miles northeast of Atlanta, have drawn support from Georgia Republicans and Democrats, including Gov. Brian Kemp (R), Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D) and former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young (D). Kemp said in a statement in February that Biden and his administration have the opportunity to support thousands of hardworking Georgians  and their communities  who would benefit from SK Innovations continued success in our state. The state of Georgia has provided $300 million in grants, land and other incentives to the South Korean company. The settlement, which is expected to be announced this weekend, allows Biden to sidestep a conflict with the ITC. The president has the authority to overturn commission rulings within 60 days, a power generally delegated to the U.S. trade representative. But a president has done so only once. In August 2013, President Barack Obama reversed an ITC ruling that would have imposed a ban on the sale of some older Apple iPhones and iPads, dealing a blow to Samsung Electronics Co. in a long-running patent battle between those two companies. SK, South Koreas third largest conglomerate, had lined up prominent advocates to press its case, including former Obama administration officials. Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, a Georgia native, said its factory should stay open to avoid disrupting the U.S. economy and efforts to fight climate change. She said the two South Korean firms should argue their positions in U.S. District Court, where LG is already suing SK. We have a severe shortage of EV batteries in the U.S. with insufficient domestic production, and the SK plant in Georgia is necessary to address this supply chain threat, she wrote. LG, however, had contended that the Biden administration should let the ITC process work. David K. Callahan, a partner at Latham & Watkins, last week disputed the idea that the United States is heading toward a shortage of EV batteries. He said LG Chem has a plant in Holland, Mich., that has been making batteries for about eight years and a joint venture with General Motors in Lordstown, Ohio. Last month, he said, LG announced $4.5 billion in commitments for two additional battery plants. Separately, Samsung announced last month it would build a plant to make battery cells, which Samsung already imports and then assembles.

            "content": "Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.V.) seemed not to mince words late last week when he offered his thoughts about the filibuster and the process known as reconciliation in an op-ed published in The Washington Post. What those words might mean for the future of President Bidens infrastructure initiative is the question his colleagues are asking. Manchin wrote, There is no circumstance in which I would vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster. He also said everyone should be alarmed at how the budget reconciliation process is being used by both parties to stifle debate, adding that reconciliation should not replace regular order in the Senate. The time has come to end these political games, he added, and to usher in a new era of bipartisanship where we find common ground on the major policy debates facing our nation. Biden has proposed an infrastructure package  using an expansive definition of infrastructure  that the White House says would cost $2.25 trillion. The money would be spent over eight years. To pay for it, the president has proposed raising taxes on corporations, though it would take 15 years of those tax increases to cover the cost. Coming soon is a second part of the package, focused on domestic issues and of a size rivaling the infrastructure portion, to be paid for through higher taxes on the wealthiest individuals. Eventually, the two pieces could end up as one big bill. As he did during the debate over Bidens nearly $2 trillion coronavirus relief and economic stimulus package, Manchin has put himself directly in the path of the passage of the new plan. In a 50-50 Senate and thus with no votes to spare, any Democrat can do so. Other Democrats will likely have changes they would like to see as the package moves forward. But Manchin is the one who has made himself the center of attention. The president has signaled his willingness to negotiate with Republicans and with Manchin. If the stimulus bill is any guide, the president soon will begin to meet with moderates from both parties to explore whether there is common ground on a subject  rebuilding the nations aging infrastructure  that has long enjoyed at least rhetorical support across the ideological spectrum. Biden sat down with some Republicans at the beginning of the stimulus debate. The Republicans countered the presidents $1.9 trillion plan with a roughly $618 billion proposal. Biden concluded that he and the Republicans were far apart and didnt believe that prolonged negotiations would change that. He moved on, corralled Democrats such as Manchin by satisfying their concerns and pushed the bill through on a party-line vote under the terms allowed by reconciliation. That is the model that many Democrats hope will be used on infrastructure. Manchin is now very much on the minds of administration officials as they begin to develop their strategy to pass the infrastructure measure, with some discussions focused on what Manchin might want and how he might be accommodated. Substantively, he has not put down many markers, though he has said he could live with a 25 percent corporate tax rate, roughly in the middle of the current 21 percent rate and the 28 percent rate Biden has proposed. Right now, his is a process argument. But he will likely have more changes in the details of the plan, as well, and administration officials are prepared for that. Meanwhile, fellow Democrats are trying to understand what political considerations might be motivating Manchin, beyond his stated preference for bipartisanship, and how, ultimately, that will affect his decision-making on infrastructure. When he writes, as he did, If I cant go home and explain it, I cant vote for it, his colleagues note that there is much in the Biden plan that would be good for a state like West Virginia. Manchin is testing the patience of some Democrats, but many recognize this is part of the price of working in an evenly divided Senate and they are reluctant to criticize him openly. They know that there is probably no other Democrat who could win a Senate race in West Virginia and that home-state considerations are important. So Manchin has some maneuvering room to try to show that his approach can still work, but it is not unlimited. Manchin has made clear he prefers to try to get back to a time when that worked. In fact, that did work as recently as a few months ago, when Manchin and other moderates were the driving forces that helped enact a $900 billion package of economic assistance in the waning days of the Trump presidency. The difference is that, in that case, Democrats were prepared to vote for a package that would be signed by a Republican president. Few people would disagree that it is better to gain bipartisan support, if possible, when enacting major legislative packages or changes. But in todays polarized environment, and particularly with Republicans dug in against Bidens agenda, the prospects for that are remote. Even those Democratic senators who generally favor trying to find bipartisan compromise, Manchin notwithstanding, doubt there are anything close to 10 GOP votes for the kind of infrastructure package Biden has proposed and perhaps even fewer Republicans willing to vote to repeal or significantly roll back President Donald Trumps tax cuts. What other Democrats are asking is: What happens if Manchins efforts to find a bipartisan compromise prove to be a dead end? What will he do then? Democrats who closely read his op-ed say that, while he came out firmly against changing the filibuster, he left himself wiggle room on reconciliation. I think he recognizes that this (reconciliation) is an existing feature of the Senate and would distinguish between that and changing the filibuster, said a Democratic senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the state of play. What makes the infrastructure package different from the stimulus bill is that Biden is asking for enough revenue to pay for it, albeit on different timelines. Thats both good and risky. Its good in the eyes of Democrats in that it negates criticism about the stimulus bill adding significantly to the deficit. Its not so good in that it would put Democrats who are up for reelection in 2022 on the line as having voted strictly along party lines to raise taxes. Right now both parts of the Biden package  the plan to rebuild infrastructure and the proposal to raise taxes on corporations and on the wealthiest Americans  are generally popular. If that holds, Democrats will be more willing to do with this package what they did with the stimulus bill, which is to enact it without Republican votes. It was a surprise to many people that the size and most of the details of Bidens stimulus bill remained intact. Whether that will be the case on this new initiative is a matter of debate, with the expectation that it may have to be shaved back in size if not in overall structure. Democrats increasingly are of a mind that the most important thing for them is to enact as much of Bidens agenda as possible  and the more ambitious the better. As another Democratic senator put it: Passing something ambitious would be much better for our fortunes in 2022 than passing something that is not ambitious or not passing anything at all. That depends in large part on whether Manchin will be there in the end as part of a unified Democratic caucus in the Senate.

            "content": "During her first three months in office, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has declared herself representative of the Republican Partys base of voters and not a fringe member of the GOP as she faced a torrent of criticism over her extremist positions, which have been denounced as falsehoods and racist. Now the Georgia Republican has the fundraising numbers to help make her case. Greene announced earlier this week that she raised a staggering $3.2 million during the first quarter of the year with more than 100,000 individual donations. Her campaign team adds that 98 percent of the donations were under $200. I am humbled, overjoyed, and so excited to announce what happened over the past few months as I have been the most attacked freshman member of Congress in history, she wrote on Twitter.  . . . The political ruling class fears the people because its the people that can take away what they love most. Power. Because its power that brings them everything else. I am one of the people and the people are with me, and I will always be with them. WE are just getting started! Greenes total amounts to a historic record in fundraising for a House freshman during an off-year election quarter, and it is the latest and clearest sign that she has tapped into a vein of support that goes well beyond her Georgia district. While Democrats took the unprecedented step to kick Greene off her congressional committees earlier this year for numerous extremist statements, the Georgia Republicans popularity among the partys base is rooted in her embrace of the cultural fights and expressions of grievance articulated by former president Donald Trump, not the traditional power structures of Congress. How Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, promoter of QAnons baseless theories, rose with support from key Republicans Republicans overall have so far largely reported a successful first quarter of fundraising, with the National Republican Congressional Committee, responsible for expanding the partys numbers in the House, bringing in $33.7 million, including $5.3 million from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and $3.5 million from Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). Lawmakers must officially file their first-quarter results with the Federal Election Commission by Wednesday. But Greenes fundraising total and the support it signifies has alarmed her detractors, who warn she represents a dangerous side of American politics bent of waging divisive battles over race and the growing diversity in the country. The American Jewish Committee has denounced some of her remarks as antisemitic, including when she suggested in a 2018 Facebook post that California wildfires were started by banking companies led by Jewish families. The group called her fundraising numbers a warning shot to American democracy. Jason Isaacson, chief policy and political affairs officer at AJC, said the group recognizes the difficult proposition it and others face when criticizing Greene because doing so only strengthens her popularity with her supporters. Speaking out, however, is the wiser choice because ignoring such dangerous forces doesnt make them go away. Its on us to expose the threat that they pose to American democracy, the rule of law, the social fabric, so it will resonate with people of conscience and diminish the threat, he said. Among Greenes incendiary and false statements in recent years are saying that Black people are held slaves to the Democratic Party, that Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, represented an Islamic invasion into our government offices, and that Jewish megadonor George Soros collaborated with Nazis. She has also expressed support for the radical ideology of QAnon, a sprawling set of false claims that have coalesced into an extremist ideology that has radicalized its followers, some of whom participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Earlier this year when her committee assignments were being challenged, Greene renounced some of her most egregious remarks but has since continued to make false claims, including that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump through voter fraud. Greene heavily relied on the narrative to raise a significant amount between Election Day and the end of 2020, early indicators of her growing support since before she took office. According to FEC filings, the Georgia Republican raised the fourth most between that time period with $230,000 for non-incumbent House candidates. A lot of her money came from her constant, almost daily email blasts to supporters echoing Trumps false claim that the presidential election was stolen from him. Republican leaders initially sought to distance themselves from Greene when she was running for Congress last year. McCarthy characterized her comments as appalling, while Scalise said they were disgusting. But since she was sworn in, they have avoided criticizing her and most House Republicans opposed stripping her of committee assignments. Only 11 Republicans voted in favor of removing their colleague from her committees, including Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), whose effort to stop Greene and other Trump-inspired lawmakers from defining the party helped him raise $2.2 million during the first quarter, three times more than he raised during the same time period in 2019. His large first-quarter fundraising haul  half of which hell give to his Country First political action committee  is another indicator of tensions within the party over how to define itself following the 2020 election. Brian Robinson, who was a spokesman for Republican Nathan Deal when he was Georgias governor and who advised Greenes primary opponent John Cowan, said Greenes appeal is undeniable but should not be seen as the direction in which the Republican Party is going. She is not representative of the national party any more than Rep. Omar is representative of national Democrats, he said. But MTG does represent a segment of the party. I would imagine though that next year in some competitive primaries, where candidates are seeking the support of the most conservative voters, that you will see some people trying to get her endorsement in the primary and then try to never mention it in the general. But she has received support from Trump, who even after his electoral defeat remains the driving force behind the partys embrace of a nationalistic brand of populism. In January when Greene was facing calls from Democrats to resign she said she received a call of support from the former president. I had a GREAT call with my all time favorite POTUS, President Trump! Greene wrote on Twitter. Im so grateful for his support and more importantly the people of this country are absolutely 100% loyal to him because he is 100% loyal to the people and America First. While Greene has received inquiries from conservatives to help them fundraise, her spokesman Nick Dyer said her team is just beginning discussions about when she will start fundraising or campaigning for America First candidates to help build a team of strong conservatives to join our efforts to hold, as she calls them, the House of Hypocrites, accountable for their actions. How she will use her fundraising prowess is unclear  she could use some of it to pay herself back the $950,000 she personally loaned her campaign  but her total could make her a more formidable force within the party. Money offers politicians power and influence; she had a record take. This shows undeniable influence. Her anti-establishment approach to politics is what allowed her to really successfully fundraise, especially off of the January 6th insurrection, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. Nevertheless, I think it comes with an asterisk that influence comes with a negative side with her colleagues and party leadership, and certainly further harms her ability to work with Democrats. And its not like she is just a stellar fundraiser with an ability to churn donors. It was a confluence of events. Greenes bombastic style has contributed to her ability to draw attention, and the money flowed after some of her more controversial statements or actions, according to Greene and her aides. As Democrats were contemplating removing her from the House Education Committee after videos from 2018 resurfaced showing her taunting Parkland High School shooting survivors on Capitol Hill and making other incendiary comments, Greene remained defiant and announced she had raised $1.6 million from supporters. She later tweeted that she had raised $175,000 the day before Democrats and 11 Republicans voted to remove her from all her committee assignments. She said she saw another significant bump in fundraising after she began to slow down House floor procedures in an effort to draw attention to the Democrats legislative agenda. In an interview with The Washington Post last month, Greene said conservatives across the country were rewarding me so nicely with small-dollar donations each time she employed delaying tactics on the floor. The people love it. A Republican operative familiar with her first-quarter fundraising numbers expressed astonishment that when Greene posted a video of herself working out in her D.C. hotel room after falsely claiming that gyms in the city were closed due to the pandemic, it prompted roughly 5,000 individuals to donate that weekend. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss fundraising disclosures that remain private until detailed in Greenes FEC filing. Greene has tried to meet supporters where they live online when raising funds and has done so successfully. Previous filings show that Greene spent $318,000 on digital advertising for fundraising on Parler, an alternative social media group used by conservatives, making it her second top expenditure during her entire campaign. Dyer blames social media giants, saying decisions by Twitter and Facebook to take down some of Greenes posts are a reason the congresswoman chose to target conservatives on other channels. Shes going where the people are, he said. Theres no strategy other than the fact that there are people there, and were going to talk to the people. Theres nothing sinister.

            "content": "Four members of an armed right-wing group linked to the anti-government boogaloo movement have been charged with conspiring to destroy evidence related to the fatal shooting of a Federal Protective Service officer and the wounding of another in Oakland, Calif., last May, prosecutors announced Friday. A federal grand jury indictment says members of the Northern California-based Grizzly Scouts tried to cover for one of their own after he allegedly gunned down the officers, deleting chat histories that included a message reading, Dudes i offed a fed. Jessie Alexander Rush, 29, Robert Jesus Blancas, 33, Simon Sage Ybarra, 23, and Kenny Matthew Miksch, 21, are accused of conspiracy to destroy records and destruction of records in official proceedings. Rush faces an additional count of obstruction of official proceedings, and Blancas is charged with an additional count of destruction of records in official proceedings. Prosecutors said the men belonged to a Facebook group named /K/alifornia Kommando and would meet in person for firearms training and other activities. According to the indictment, the Facebook groups description read, they say the west wont boog  a phrase, prosecutors say, that refers to the boogaloo movement, a loose collection of anti-government extremists who agitate for civil war. All four men remained in federal custody over the weekend. If convicted, each could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.A lawyer for Blancas declined to comment on the case. Attorney information for the other defendants wasnt immediately available. The indictment comes as domestic terrorism incidents have soared in the United States and law enforcement agencies face pressure to crack down on far-right extremists after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6. The charges in this case are the latest targeting alleged adherents of the boogaloo movement, whose followers became increasingly visible at protests after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25, 2020. Numerous self-proclaimed boogaloo followers have been arrested in attacks or connection with alleged plots in recent months, among them three alleged members in Nevada who were accused of plotting to use molotov cocktails to spark violence at a rally over Floyds death. The shooting of the agents in Oakland happened on May 29 outside a federal courthouse during a racial justice demonstration in the citys downtown. According to investigators, Steven Carrillo, a 32-year-old Air Force staff sergeant, was using the gathering as cover when he fired an assault rifle at a guard post from a moving vehicle. The shots killed Officer David Patrick Underwood, 53, and seriously injured a second officer. On June 6, authorities tracked Carrillo to a property in Ben Lomond, Calif., more than 70 miles from Oakland. As deputies surrounded the property, Carrillo sent a flurry of WhatsApp messages to members of the Grizzly Scouts in a group chat labeled 209 Goon HQ, according to the indictment. One message told the members to kit up and get here and to take them out, according to the indictment. Another allegedly read: Dudes i offed a fed. Rush, whom prosecutors described as commanding officer of the Grizzly Scouts, told Carrillo to factory reset his phone, deleting its stored communications, according to the indictment. Carrillo was arrested that afternoon after a gun battle that left one officer from the Santa Cruz County Sheriffs Office dead and others injured. When authorities searched the vehicles used by Carrillo, police said, they found a boogaloo patch, ammunition, firearms, bombmaking equipment and three boogaloo-related messages scrawled in blood: I became unreasonable, Boog and Stop the duopoly. Carrillo pleaded not guilty to counts of murder and attempted murder in federal and state courts in connection with the shootout during his arrest and the Oakland shooting. A lawyer representing Carrillo in federal court declined to comment on his case and the allegations in Fridays indictment. While Carrillo was being processed last summer, the four other Grizzly Scouts now indicted deleted all the 209 Goon HQ chat logs from their phones, the indictment says, and reconnected on an alternative communications application. There, they turned on a disappearing messages function, automatically erasing their chats after a certain period, according to prosecutors. Blancas, described in the indictment as a 1st lieutenant in the Grizzly Scouts and responsible for security and intelligence, also deleted 20 files related to the armed group from a Dropbox account, prosecutors said. The materials included documents related to the groups structure, a nondisclosure agreement, a liability release waiver, and a scorecard to assess members of the Grizzly Scouts with respect to combat, firearms, medical, and other training, according to the indictment. Afterward, the members repeatedly confirmed with one another that they had destroyed evidence relating to the Grizzly Scouts, prosecutors said. In August, FBI agents searched properties connected with the four defendants. They confiscated assault rifles, pistols, body armor, ammunition, and electronic devices, according to the indictment. Rush, Ybarra and Miksch made their initial appearances in federal court this week. Blancas already was in federal custody after being arrested in November on a charge of enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity, records show. Agents who seized his electronic devices said they found child pornography and sexually explicit messages with a 15-year-old girl, according to records. He entered a plea of not guilty in December. His attorney in that case did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning."

            "content": "When senators summoned Pentagon leaders to answer for a rash of sexual assaults in the military in 2013, the assembled brass were undivided in their resistance to plans that would strip commanders of their power over prosecuting those crimes, warning the changes would undermine discipline in the ranks. Eight years later, opposition from top military officials  even as they pledge zero tolerance for a problem that has defied decades of attempted reforms  remains unchanged. What has changed is the politics surrounding the issue, with new signals from the White House, an increased focus on the militarys lack of high-level diversity and shifting societal views on sexual assault in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Its unclear whether proposals that would give specialized military prosecutors, rather than unit commanders, the power to decide which alleged sexual assaults are subject to military trial will muster enough votes to pass in Congress. Among the measures being considered is one first introduced in 2013 by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) that the senator and co-sponsors hope to reintroduce this month. Support for more systemic change appears to be growing as lawmakers express impatience with the militarys inability to curb an epidemic of sexual harassment and assault. And as momentum builds for change, Pentagon leaders are quietly facing a reckoning between traditional military norms and intensified pressure over the scourge of sexual assault. Every general or commander that has come in front of this body for the past 10 years has told us, Weve got this, maam, weve got this,  Gillibrand said at a hearing in March. Well, the truth is they dont have it. Pentagon statistics show that reports of sexual assault in the military are on the rise, most often affecting female service members ages 17 to 24. Events such as the murder of Army Spec. Vanessa Guillen, who had confided to her family about sexual harassment before her death but did not report it to her superiors, have drawn attention to troops mistrust in the military justice process. Scrutiny of sexual assault is growing at a time when the Pentagon, spurred partly by race-related unrest in 2020, launches new steps to address the underrepresentation of minorities and women in the upper ranks. Studies show that female service members are more likely to leave the military earlier than men, often citing the toll of sexual harassment and assault. Like others before it, the Biden administration has promised aggressive action on sex crimes in the ranks. Shortly after taking office, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the retired general President Biden named as the countrys first African American Pentagon chief, announced a three-month review by an independent commission. Speaking to reporters last month, chair Lynn Rosenthal said the commission would make recommendations for major shifts in the handling of sexual assault and would study the proposal to take certain prosecution decisions out of the chain of command. Whats different today, quite frankly, is this is not a closed door, she said. Advocates of the change proposed by Gillibrand describe it as a light touch that would leave most unit commanders powers intact. Already, previous changes have limited commanders ability to adjudicate subordinates, elevating the power to refer sex crimes to courts-martial to the level of Army colonels or Navy captains and restricting commanders ability to lessen punishment or overturn convictions. Under the current system, those select commanders, with input from lawyers working under them, can decide whether cases involving their subordinates go to court-martial, result in lesser punishment or are dismissed. But because commanders are not lawyers and often are inexperienced in handling sexual assault, advocates say, they are not adequately equipped to decide which cases should be tried. Moreover, because commanders may know the accused or may fear retaliation from their chain of command, troops may decide against reporting assaults. The proposed legislation, in contrast, would give specialized military prosecutors outside the chain of command authority to refer felony-type crimes to courts-martial, including grave sex crimes and murders. Commanders would retain authority over lesser infractions and military-specific crimes like desertion or disobedience. Don Christensen, a retired Air Force prosecutor who has advocated for the shift, said the change would apply to fewer than 150 officers now empowered to make prosecutorial referrals, a tiny share of commanders across the military. But critics of the measure say it would undermine the central tenet of commanders responsibility for their subordinates and weaken those officers investment in deterring sexual assault because their career trajectories would no longer be tied to it. It would also disrupt a uniformed justice system that has a better record of sex-crime convictions than civilian courts. The real solution, they contend, is more prevention and accountability. Multiple military-backed studies have reached the same conclusion. It is neither feasible nor advisable to remove commanders as the central figure of the military justice system, a 2020 study mandated by Congress found. As in 2013, all of the militarys current service leaders, including Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday, Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger, have voiced opposition to the Gillibrand proposal. In 2019, Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote that he strongly supports the present system. The commander is responsible for everything the unit does and fails to do, he said. But current and former officials say military leaders may now feel constrained in forcefully articulating their opposition, in part because Biden, at a campaign event in 2020, had indicated support for the change and because previous eradication efforts havent worked. Theres a recognition the trend is going the wrong way and its not getting better, said one former senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue candidly. If you look at it from that perspective, its hard to defend the department position, the official said. And whoever does that will come under intense scrutiny because the performance hasnt been there. Through a spokesman, Milley, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, declined to comment on the proposal but called sexual assault a form of fratricide that must be stopped. It is corrosive to the very essence of what it means to be in the military, he said. For Austin, the debate represents an intersection between the values he espoused during his 40-year military career and his new role as a political appointee. While he declined to state his position on the proposed change when asked by Gillibrand during his confirmation hearing, Austin has suggested he will accept the commissions recommendations. He may be especially likely to do so as he seeks to establish his credentials as a civilian leader following criticism of Bidens decision to nominate a recently retired general, the second in four years, to head the Defense Department. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Austin would keep an open mind. He doesnt want to take anything off the table as we try to tackle this again, he said. While Gillibrands proposal has secured support from Republican lawmakers including Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Pentagon opposition has contributed to its failure to gain traction in past years. A proposal to make similar changes in the House, put forward last year by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), likewise did not advance. The reason this has been stopped year after year is that the generals and the admirals have come in and said, Dont do this,  Christensen said. If the commander in chief supports it, that shuts them up. This year, Pentagon officials are eyeing several senators, including Jack Reed (D-R.I.), chairman of Senate Armed Services Committee, and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who they believe could embrace the proposal, and catalyze support from others, if Austin embraces it. While Reed has voted against the plan in the past, spokesman Chip Unruh said he would review the commission recommendations. The simple fact is, there is no easy fix or silver bullet here, Unruh said. In an interview, Gillibrand said she believed conditions in Congress  and society  were more favorable than they were in 2013 because of the #MeToo movement and because the incidence of military sexual assault has not improved. But, she said, she has detected no change from Pentagon leaders. She pointed to the military leaderships history of resistance to racial and gender integration and more permissive policies for gay, lesbian and transgender troops. I think its part of the culture of the military to keep the status quo, she said. If you are top brass, it means youve succeeded in the current system. And so particularly the group of commanders are looking in and saying, We did fine. This wasnt a problem.

            "content": "U.S. climate envoy John F. Kerry is expected to travel to China next week in an attempt to carve out climate change as an area of closer collaboration amid deepening tensions between the two countries. The former secretary of state is expected to travel to Shanghai for meetings with Chinese officials, according to people familiar with the situation. The trip, less than a month after a face-to-face meeting between senior Chinese and U.S. diplomats in Alaska ended in traded diatribes and insults, would be the first official visit to China by a top Biden administration official. A State Department spokesman said the department does not have any travel to announce at this time. Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions about the potential visit. Kerry planned to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua, Chinas special climate envoy, according to one U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive visit, which could still be called off. Kerry and Xie have already started discussions, according to the State Department. The trip underlines the Biden administrations efforts to collaborate with  as well as compete against  China as the two sides clash over human rights, trade practices and security while competing for global influence. Kerry has repeatedly said the global climate crisis should be treated separately, describing it as a critical stand-alone issue that requires the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases to work together. The trip would be part of Kerrys tour in Asia through India, the United Arab Emirates and Bangladesh, ahead of a two-day virtual Earth Day summit hosted by the United States on April 22 and 23. In India last week, Kerry said he was hopeful but not confident that he could count on Chinas cooperation. We want to work with China in doing this. What President Biden has said is, we will have our differences on some issues, he told India Today. We cant be the prisoners of all of these differences. We must cooperate on climate. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said earlier this month that Beijing had received the invitation to the Earth Day summit and is looking at it. Without mentioning the United States, Hua said Beijing would continue to enhance communication and cooperation with the international community. Observers say climate change is one of few areas where U.S. and Chinese interests could overlap, raising the possibility of restarting talks halted during the Trump administration, which withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, a move now reversed by Biden as he tries to position the United States as a leader in limiting climate change. In September, China announced that it aimed to become carbon neutral by 2060. Following the contentious meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Anchorage in March, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported that the two sides had decided to set up a working group on climate change among other modest but specific joint initiatives. But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that no such agreements were made  a point analysts said reflected the Biden administrations aversion to get trapped into Beijings style of formalized meetings that may or may not produce results. These are all things that were without appeal to the U.S. side because it's all process and no substance, and the Chinese have used process as a kind of straitjacket to bind the United States and create the impression that theres more amity in the relationship than there really is, said Danny Russel, a former senior diplomat in the Obama administration and vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Kerry, an advocate of personal diplomacy in his years as secretary of state and a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has long valued face-to-face meetings with foreign officials in pursuit of consensus-building. In February, Chinas Ministry of Ecology and Environment said Xies office had been renamed as the countrys special climate envoy, a move seen as a response to Kerrys appointment. Xie had headed his countrys climate delegation from 2007 to 2018, a time when he would have worked with Kerry, who was serving as secretary of state under the Obama administration. China and the United States are two largest emitters in the world. It is not like they have a choice on whether to work together or not, said Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer for Greenpeace East Asia.

            "content": "LONDON  Buckingham Palace announced Saturday that Prince Philip's funeral will take place at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17  but in keeping with government lockdown measures, the ceremony will be \"much reduced in scale with no public access.\" The palace said the number of mourners will be limited to 30. Both the British government and the royal family asked the public to stay home rather than pay respects in person. There will be no public processions or viewings. Philip was the longest-serving consort in British history and husband to Queen Elizabeth II for 73 years, and the royal family said he expressed his wishes for a low-key affair. He died Friday at age 99, just two months shy of the century mark. There will be eight days of national mourning. Prince Harry will travel from Southern California to attend the funeral, but his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, will not  based on medical advice, a spokeswoman for the couple said. Meghan is pregnant with their second child, due in the summer. She suffered a miscarriage last year, which she wrote about in the New York Times. The funeral list is so tight that Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not attend to open a spot for a member of the royal family. Philip and Elizabeth have four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, plus their spouses. On Saturday, Prince Charles released a videotaped statement from his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire. He emerged from the home, dressed in a blue suit and black tie, looking downcast and calling Prince Philip my dear papa. Charles began, speaking without notes: I particularly want to say. . . . My father, I suppose the last 70 years, has given the most remarkable, devoted service to the queen, to my family, and to the country, and also to the whole of the commonwealth. And, as you can imagine, my family and I miss my father enormously. He was, Charles added, a much loved and appreciated figure. He ended: Thank you. Thank you. Then he turned and went back inside his home, as viewers could hear bird calls from the estate gardens. The funeral will take place entirely within the walls of Windsor Castle. The palace announced: His Royal Highnesss coffin will be carried in a purpose-built Land Rover  which The Duke was involved in the design of  flanked by military Pall Bearers, in a small Ceremonial Procession from the State Entrance to St Georges Chapel, for the Funeral Service. The eight pallbearers and the dean of Windsor and the archbishop of Canterbury, who will officiate, will not be counted in the limit of 30, the BBC reported. Since the death announcement at noon Friday, the queen has been visited at Windsor by Charles and her other three children, Anne, Andrew and Edward. Around the country on Saturday, signs of mourning were everywhere: royal staff in black, a 41-round gun salute. The Union Jack was at half-staff, and will remain so until a day after the funeral. Many of these tributes are based on long-standing royal protocol. Others reflect pandemic-related restrictions. To announce Philips death on Friday, a plaque, per royal tradition, was placed in front of Buckingham Palace, reading: It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was, however, removed later in the day, amid fears that it was attracting crowds in violation of limits on public gatherings. With the safety and well-being of the public in mind, and in accordance with government guidelines, members of the public are asked not to gather in crowds, the palace said in a statement Friday. Those wishing to express their condolences are asked to do so in the safest way possible, and not to gather at Royal Residences. Britons, nonetheless, continued to gather to leave floral tributes in front of palaces and mark the moment in pictures and collective mourning. At noon in Britain, a nationwide 41-gun salute was held to honor the former naval officer and World War II veteran. The Church of England, which Elizabeth officially heads, published prayer resources for churches to use during the mourning period. Others incorporated socially distanced moments of silence into their Saturday plans, such as at sporting events, which the prince avidly supported. The life and complicated legacy of Prince Philip dominated British media coverage on Saturday. Over many decades, Prince Philip ran the gamut in the British press: at times scolded, mocked and lauded for everything from cringeworthy comments to his dutiful service to the crown. But some were frustrated by the attention over the late Duke of Edinburgh in a year in which the coronavirus has officially killed nearly 3 million people worldwide and more than 125,000 in Britain. There was also concern that coverage of Philips death on Friday was overshadowing other pressing developments in Britain, such as ongoing unrest in Northern Ireland over Brexit trade rules, as well as glossing over the less flattering parts of his life and the British monarchys impact. Initial ratings by Britains Broadcast Audience Research Board found that the BBC and ITV, two British networks that on Friday pulled other coverage to prioritize the royal news, had major drops in viewers this week compared with last, according to the Independent. The BBC set up a web form specifically for Philip coverage-related complaints. Although the corporation [BBC] is used to finding itself in the middle of Britains culture wars, its handling of Philips death points to a deeper question over the ability of a national broadcaster to force the country together to mourn a single individual in an era where audiences are fragmented and less deferential, reported the Guardian. British media also conveyed the condolences pouring in from leaders around the world, including Pope Francis and all five living former U.S. presidents. Berger reported from Jerusalem.

            "content": "Metro on Saturday required its employees to trigger a full emergency response whenever a passenger train, bus or MetroAccess car breaks down in lieu of several safety and reporting failures that officials said occurred last month, including an unreported runaway train. As we reviewed these incidents, it became clear to me that additional steps are needed to achieve our organizational commitment to a Safety Trumps Service operating ethos, Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said in an internal memo obtained by The Washington Post. Together, these actions move us another step forward toward strengthening a culture of safety within our operations. The missteps are just the latest involving Metros Rail Operations Control Center, or ROCC, which has been under pressure to reform its safety response and reporting practices and procedures since the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission issued a 50-page audit in September that described the main control room for all Metrorail operations as a toxic workplace and cited 21 safety failures or workplace issues it said put Metro passengers and workers at risk. The latest problems stemmed from a March 26 event when a Red Line train had a mechanical problem and stopped about 100 yards from the Rhode Island Metro station in Northwest Washington, stranding 109 passengers onboard. After more than an hour, riders were escorted off the train, and no one was seriously injured. Two people were treated on the scene for dehydration and anxiety. The breakdowns cause is under investigation. But it was in the response and reporting of the breakdown where Metro made several missteps, Wiedefeld said. Customers sat onboard for 90 minutes without necessary guidance, he said. Two passengers evacuated the train themselves, a dangerous move on Metros busy tracks that include an electrified third rail that powers the system. Police were called in late to assist, Wiedefeld said. Communications between the ROCC and the field were inadequate regarding recovery efforts, Wiedefeld said. After passengers were safely offloaded from the train, Metro employees started preparing the disabled rail cars for a tow to Metros rail yard. It was then that the disabled train rolled about 137 feet on its own before a Metro worker could apply a hand brake to stop it. Wiedefeld said the train ran away at a speed of less than 5 mph and that no one was hurt. The workers on the scene did not report the rolling train to Metros ROCC and Safety department. While no employees were injured, nor was there equipment damage, rail operations personnel at the scene failed to report the train rolling to ROCC or the Safety department (SAFE), Wiedefeld wrote. Internal safety inspectors discovered the event while listening to audio recordings of communications dispatches during a post-incident review, he said. But Max Smith, spokesman for the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, an independent agency created by Congress to monitor Metrorail safety, said thats not true. It was the commissions inspectors who learned of the runaway train during their investigation, and they in turn told Metro safety officials about it. They also first learned about the two passengers who had evacuated themselves. The [safety commission] identified several issues in this event that were not initially identified by [Metro],\" Smith said. The [commission] has required full reporting and accurate reporting of the customer self-evacuation and the runaway train event. Smith said Metro also failed to notify the Federal Transit Administration of the runaway train, as federal regulations require. Wiedefeld said that in the wake of the missteps he is changing the way Metro responds to breakdowns of any of its passenger vehicles, including Metrorail, Metrobus and MetroAccess, which is Metros paratransit service for disabled customers. Rail operations, he said, will develop instructions and retrain staff on how to attach rail cars properly. Metros Safety department and its Office of Emergency Management will have representatives in the ROCC on a 24-7 basis to coordinate incident response. Metro employees will develop a playbook on how to assure and monitor passengers during service delays, breakdowns or disruptions. Safety officials will remind Metro staff of their duty to report unusual occurrences, such as rolling events, Wiedefeld said. Wiedefeld said he is also lowering the threshold for what is considered an emergency at Metro. Any time a train, bus or MetroAccess car breaks down, he said, emergency management staff must be notified. Many emergency functions that are not law-enforcement or first-responder related will move out of the auspices of Metro Transit police and under the umbrella of Metros Safety department to help improve coordination. By Monday, all incidents of trains, buses, and paratransit vehicles disabled for any reason and for any amount of time will qualify for a new, lower threshold for internal notifications of all departments, Wiedefeld said. They include Metros Safety department, rail and bus operations, Metros Customer Service and Communication Marketing department and Metro Transit Police. Wiedefeld said Metros chief safety officer, Theresa M. Impastato, will develop a strategic plan to improve its entire emergency response program. Infrastructure plan calls for $80 billion for rail. It could transform passenger service. A woman called for a highways removal in a Black neighborhood. The White House singled it out in its infrastructure plan. Two states tax some drivers by the mile. Many more want to give it a try.

            "content": "BOSTON  The line started outside, on a street usually teeming with people waiting to enter college bars, and snaked up the stairs of an old firehouse to the Brazilian Worker Center, where shots of the coronavirus vaccine were being administered on this cold New England spring morning. Finally, it was Maria Sousas turn. She had been waiting for more than an hour with her husband and daughter when a center volunteer greeted them in Portuguese and guided them to the registration desk, where they presented their identification  Brazilian passports. Getting vaccinated here was the only option they considered. Immigrants have been turned away from pharmacies and other places after being asked for drivers licenses, Social Security numbers or health insurance cards  specific documentation not mandated by states or the federal government but often requested at vaccination sites across the country, including right down the road from here. Often the request comes in English, a language many of the vaccine-seekers dont fully understand. Some state agencies and businesses that provide vaccinations have acknowledged the problem and vowed that it will stop. Sousas family wasnt willing to take the risk. Here, there was someone to intervene if requests for more information arose  and they did. When the woman behind the desk entered Sousas name, a picture popped up on her screen. Since the 43-year-old was wearing a mask, the woman asked for an address to determine whether it was the same person. When the address didnt match what was in the system, she pressed for more information. Watching as a volunteer tried to help Sousa, the centers executive director stepped in.Theregistrarswere to accept whatever ID was presented, using the centers address if necessary. The life-or-death race to get as many people vaccinated aspossible before the coronavirus spawns more viral mutations, like the one that emerged in Brazil, started slowly but has accelerated as many of those crossing the finish line possess the wherewithal and inclination to navigate a mazelike system. As the nation nears the point where supply soon outpaces demand, the unvaccinated will increasingly be people who are reluctant or whoare rebuffed by barriers blocking their way. Weve done a good job of equality in rolling out the vaccine. A lot of states have opened to everyone 16 and over now, said Jeffrey Hines, medical director for diversity, inclusion and health equity at Wellstar Health System in Atlanta. But equality is not equity. Equality means giving everyone the same resources and opportunities, whereas equity takes into account peoples varying circumstances and allocates resources based on need to reach an equal outcome. Equality can get things done quickly, Hines said. Equity needs to be done more intentionally. The federal government says everyone has a right to the coronavirus vaccine regardless of immigration status, with the Department of Homeland Security calling it a moral and public health imperative to ensure that all individuals residing in the United States have access to the vaccine. But each states registration process is different, and vaccination sites often make up their own rules  policies inflaming racial and ethnic divides in coronavirus vaccinations. Twenty-six states restrict access to people who live and work there, status that can be proved with a utility bill or a work ID. But only about one-quarter of state websites make it clear that undocumented immigrants are eligible for the shot and that getting vaccinated will not negatively affect immigration status, according to recent analyses by the health policy group Kaiser Family Foundation. Only 10 states and D.C., which have residency requirements, also allow undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licenses or state identification cards. Massachusetts is not one of them, and the states website telling people how to prepare for their vaccine appointment says that although vaccination sites might request an ID or insurance card, that only applies to people that have them. The idea of having to be IDd is a major source of stress for immigrants, said Natalcia Tracy, executive director of Bostons Brazilian Worker Center, a nonprofit dedicated to defending and advancing labor and immigrant rights. When people ask for ID, they say Massachusetts ID. They dont say any ID. It is often left up to the very people made vulnerable by these ad hoc rules to push back against them. Experts and immigration advocates say that while talk about closing the gap in vaccination rates has focused largely on bolstering acceptance of vaccines, access to them must be part of the conversation, too. Thats especially true, they say, in communities still reeling from immigration policies implemented during the Trump administration that were openly hostile to immigrants of color. Its very easy to say vaccine hesitation, said Frankie Miranda, president of the Hispanic Federation, a New York-based nonprofit and advocacy group. Instead, he said, a constellation of factors come into play, including the time and technology required to book appointments online, the need for transportation to vaccination sites and translation services  even the language used on promotional fliers. Take, for instance, a colorful, bilingual bulletin advertising a recent drive-through vaccination event in one North Carolina county. It included images of a diverse cluster of masked essential workers, a group made up disproportionately of people of color and immigrants. Yet in English and Spanish, the flier proclaimed citizens 65 and older are eligible for vaccination. Already, youre sending the message: dont come here, Miranda said. This is an example where language can hamper your efforts to reach out to the community you actually want to help. Many immigrants wont risk the consequences of coming forward to be vaccinated at unfamiliar places,advocates and public health experts say  even though their jobs, housing and underlying health conditions place them at higher risk of infection. Vulnerable populations are going to go to those places where they have trust,\" Hines said. \"They may not necessarily go to the mass vax site. Administering thousands of shots at big facilities might be a quicker way to get as many people vaccinated as possible, but youre going to chip away at the number of unvaccinated people in marginalized communities by using trusted spaces, he said. The Brazilian Worker Center administered more than 200 shots on Good Friday. But that was only a small fraction of those seeking protection. The centers vaccination waiting list: 2,500, and growing. If it was not for the center, we wouldnt take the vaccine, said Sousa, whose family emigrated 18 months ago from So Paulo. Theres a tremendous amount of distress in the immigrant community. Rumors run rampant, said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. There needs to be a much more substantial and very targeted investment in outreach  almost on the scale of census outreach after the failed attempt to add a citizenship question. Its absolutely necessary. During the 2020 Census, local, state and federal agencies sought to assuage the fears of immigrants and their families, both legal and undocumented, urging them to fight the undercount and participate in the enumeration. We have to call out peoples fears and address them directly. It cant be generic, We should all get vaccinated, and its a good thing,  Saenz said. We need to be very clear about the message: Absolutely no one will face any consequence related to immigration enforcement or any other enforcement. Its got to be that specific. Despite thecoronavirus carving a disproportionate path of death and disease through communities of color, vaccination rates in counties with predominantly Black and Latino populations are lower than those with mostly Native American, White or Asian American residents, federaldata shows. Covid-19 was the leading cause of death among Latinos and led Black people to have the highest age-adjusted death rate overall last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is little to no data on the infection, death or vaccination rates of immigrants specifically. From nearly two decades of work advocating for immigrants, Juvencio Rocha-Peralta, executive director of the grass-roots Association of Mexicans in North Carolina,said he knew when the pandemic began that this community was going to be invisible. Conversations about public health and marginalized people in the state tended to exclude Latino immigrants, especially on the local level, said Rocha-Peralta, whose organization has recently partnered with health departments to hold vaccination events. Theyre talking about White and Black, and thats all, he said, but the needs of the immigrant community are distinct. This community doesnt have documents. Dont have drivers licenses like everybody else, he said. But we still continue to see information out there requiring identification, which is a big no-no. Its a fear for the community. Tracy, the head of the Brazilian Worker Center, personally confronted the issue when she received her dose at a mass vaccination site in Boston. A friend accompanying her was offered a vaccination without an appointment or a request for ID. He declined, saying he was there to support Tracy, who is Afro-Brazilian. The woman then turned to me and said, Whats your name? Let me see a Massachusetts ID. I want to make sure youre a Massachusetts resident,  Tracy said. I was so upset. I felt she racially profiled me, Tracy said. Here she is willing to give a vaccine to someone  a White male without an accent  who didnt have an appointment without asking for ID. If I was undocumented that would have freaked me out. A survivor of labor-trafficking who arrived in the United States as a 19-year-old whospoke no English and with a eighth-grade education, Tracy said she identifies with being voiceless, being invisible, marginalized. Im totally obsessed with justice and get pissed about inequality, she said in her cramped office, her doctorate from Boston University resting in a frame on the wall behind her desk. The Brazilian Worker Center advocates for the nearly 100,000 Brazilians in Massachusetts. It fought to reunite children separated from their families by the Trump administrations hard-line immigration policies, ensured members were counted by the census, and established a food program when the pandemic forced people out of work and into hunger. Tracy said the centers vaccination clinics were partly inspired by the health activism of the Black Panther party, which deemed inadequate social services a form of oppression. The Panthers opened free health clinics across the country, including one in Boston, that offered checkups, immunizations, blood tests and health education. She said she encountered resistance to the idea of administering vaccines at first, saying local officials wanted the center to focus on vaccine education. Tracy persisted, saying she made noise everywhere I went by insisting that access was necessary to eliminate disparities. Then the centers first vaccination clinic was scheduled, with the help of Lawyers for Civil Rights, a nonprofit that promotes equal opportunity and fights discrimination on behalf of people of color and immigrants,and the Whittier Street Health Center, which provides primary care and support services to primarily low-income and racially and ethnically diverse populations. Excited, she hopped online and made a quick video to let Facebook followers know. Immediately, the center was enveloped by demand, and the phones havent stopped ringing since.

            "content": "Amazons defeat of a union organizing effort in Alabama on Friday was the latest setback for workers who have been clamoring to assert more control over the technology companies that depend on them  one that showed how Silicon Valley giants still have a major edge in determining where power resides in the modern economy. Labor advocates expressed dismay after a push to organize Amazons Bessemer, Ala., warehouse was rejected by a surprisingly large margin of workers amid fierce opposition from the Seattle-based e-commerce giant. The advocates, who have complained for years about worker treatment at Amazon warehouses, came to see the Bessemer warehouse as a top prospect for gaining a foothold in one of Americas biggest and most powerful companies. The defeat comes amid a series of clashes between the nations major technology companies and workers who say they are not reaping the rewards of the digital economy, at a time when the share prices of many tech giants have reached all time highs and created hundreds of billions of dollars in new wealth. California voters approved a ballot initiative in November, Proposition 22, exempting Uber and Lyft from classifying millions of drivers as employees  in essence denying those gig workers a minimum wage and other benefits. Similar fights have emerged at Facebook and Google, where large numbers of workers employed by third-party contractors complained they were not getting fair treatment by the tech behemoths. After the Bessemer vote, labor advocates say they will argue their case that Amazon acted illegally to squash the vote  and, more broadly, are placing their hopes in a new administration in Washington led by avowedly pro-union President Biden, who gave his blessing to the Bessemer effort. Once workers understand that historically the work has had better working conditions and pays much better than what Amazon thinks theyre worth, then youre going to have this upheaval, said Randy Korgan, who leads efforts to unionize Amazon for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and was not involved in the Bessemer drive. Companies like Amazon and Uber say they are already at the leading edge of providing strong compensation, benefits and flexibility to workers. Amazon routinely notes it pays a $15 minimum wage to workers  which liberals have pushed for the national standard. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) We hope that with this election now over, theres an opportunity to move from talk to action across the country, the company said in a statement Friday. While our team is more than a million people around the world and weve created 500,000 new jobs since Covid began, were still a tiny fraction of the workforce. There are 40 million Americans who make less than the starting wage at Amazon, and many more who dont get health care through their employers, and we think that should be fixed. Still, the prospect of a pro-labor president  at a time when bashing technology companies has become a bipartisan pastime on Capitol Hill as well  threatens to tilt the policy battleground against Silicon Valley. The companies are facing a new threat of regulation that could limit their power and upend their business models. And unions are hoping Democrats pass legislation that would drastically strengthen workers ability to organize. Biden, whose margin of victory was narrow in several heavily unionized battleground states, tweeted a video in February praising the organizing efforts in Alabama and declaring, Unions built the middle class. And his recent infrastructure plan includes pro-union measures. Tech companies have long been successful at squashing worker activism. The industry has cultivated a sense of exceptionalism around its highest-paid workers, engineers who are lavished with perks, stock options and benefits. Silicon Valley likewise positioned the work itself as a benefit to society. But that perception has been increasingly challenged in recent years. A year ago, Amazon fired two tech workers after they publicly denounced conditions at its warehouses as unsafe during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, hundreds of Google employees signed a letter demanding better treatment of temporary workers. The same year, hundreds of engineers and tech workers from companies including Twitter and Facebook signed an open letter pledging not to work for DoorDash until the company stopped cheating drivers out of their tips and set a pay floor. Although engineers are the highly paid superstars of Silicon Valley, tech campuses also rely on thousands of subcontracted shuttle bus drivers, cafeteria workers, and janitorial staff. At Google, similarly to other tech giants, the shadow workforce of contractors now outnumbers its pool of 135,000 full-time employees and includes roles in engineering and management but without access to the same benefits. The technology industry is revolutionary, but the way work is done still looks a lot like it always did, said Heidi Shierholz, a former top economist for the Labor Department under President Barack Obama, now policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. The majority of workers in warehousing and transportation, like every other private sector industry in United States are not unionized. However, 17 percent are unionized nationwide, the second-highest rate for the private sector after utility workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That includes at shipping partner UPS, which is organized by the Teamsters. Amazon, facing political pressure in 2018, raised its minimum wage for its hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers to $15 an hour. That  along with benefits like health care and continuing education  have been primary selling points for the company, particularly as it fights off unionization. (The minimum wage in Alabama is $7.25, while the starting wage in Bessemer is $15.30.) Nonsupervisory production workers in the warehousing and storage field average $18.52 an hour nationally, however, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This figure isnt directly comparable because it reflects the average wage, not the minimum wage. Amazon on Friday celebrated its win in a blog post touting its wages and benefits. Amazons campaign against the organizing effort raised a public outcry and galvanized support for the union even before the 1,798-to-738 vote on Friday. Amazon bombarded workers with anti-union messages under the slogan Do it without dues through text messages, signs in bathroom stalls and mandatory meetings at the warehouse. Amazon also successfully petitioned the county to change the stoplight patterns in front of its facility, in what some workers said was a bid to make it harder to organize. It had the U.S. Postal Service install an unmarked mailbox at the facility in the midst of the election, something the union said could prompt workers to think Amazon would count their votes. It also put up a website that said all workers would have to pay dues in Alabama, a state where that isnt required with unionized employers. An unnamed worker filed an unfair labor practices complaint to the National Labor Relations Board over the website. The union said it plans to file another about the mailbox, saying it sent a misleading message to workers about the election process. Anyone who has ever tried to make a change at their workplace isnt surprised by Amazons behavior, said Beth Allen, communications director for Communications Workers of America, which helped workers at Alphabet, Googles parent company, launch a minority union in January. Amazon has defended its approach to the union-organizing effort. Company spokeswoman Heather Knox said, It will impact everyone at the site, and its important all associates understand what that means for them and their day-to-day life working at Amazon. Amazon has said the mailbox provides a convenient way for workers to vote and that the website was an educational site to help employees understand the facts about joining a union. Allen, like other labor advocates, said the experience made clear that action from Washington has become necessary. Many Democrats, including the president, are pushing for the Senate to pass the Pro Act, which would overhaul the countrys labor laws to give workers more leverage when organizing. The bill would create harsher penalties for companies that violate laws protecting worker activism, allow gig workers to potentially form unions and outlaw some of the coercive anti-union activity that many companies, including Amazon, have employed in the face of union drives. I cant imagine a better example of why the Pro Act is necessary than the last few months of what Amazon has done in this election, said labor lawyer Brandon Magner, who writes the Labor Law Lite newsletter. Beyond proposing legislation, Biden also is nominating noted skeptics of tech industry power to key positions. That includes a prominent advocate for considering antitrust action against Amazon  Columbia University associate law professor Lina Khan  to the Federal Trade Commission, which shares with the Justice Department responsibility for enforcing the nations antitrust laws. Biden also has chosen to the National Economic Council outspoken scholar Tim Wu, author of The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age, to advise him on technology and competition policy. Vanita Gupta, who in her previous post as president of the Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights issued pointed critiques of Facebooks civil rights record, is Bidens nominee as associate attorney general, the No. 3 post at the Justice Department. Those moves come in addition to federal and state moves  begun during the Trump administration  to pursue antitrust investigations against some of the biggest names in tech, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook. Last year, Congress for the first time grilled the CEOs of those four companies, demanding answers from them on acquisitions and other monopolistic behaviors. The growth of big tech has outpaced legislation to control them, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in an interview with The Post after the union vote count. We need the Attorney General to start looking at the antitrust implications of some of the growth of some of these companies, and we need legislation to address it as well. Silicon Valley has had an anti-union reputation since the 1970s, as the regions fruit orchards were transformed into an electronics hub. Industry leaders touted automation, but pioneered the use of subcontractors in its offices and relied on immigrants and undocumented workers in its factories to avoid offering the kind of protections standard in manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the country. The perks now synonymous with working in tech, such as stock options and free lunches, were awarded to full-time employees in part to ward off labor unions. But companies narrowly defined who counted as a tech worker and had access to the benefits and high salaries. Even as far back as 1998, engineers for Microsoft hired as contractors attempted to unionize, but efforts faltered. In 2000, the Communications Workers of America unsuccessfully tried to persuade 400 Amazon call-center workers in Seattle to unionize. In the early 2010s, when bus drivers, security guards, cafeteria workers, and other subcontracted swaths of workers who served in the San Francisco Bay areas sprawling tech campuses began unionizing and fighting for fair wages and working conditions, it drew little attention from the tech press or support from white collar tech workers. But years of backlash against the tech industry, including public criticism from white-collar workers disillusioned by what they thought was a different kind of capitalism, has exposed some of these hidden hierarchies. Now, tech companies are increasingly pressured to be accountable for the treatment of vital swaths of their workforce that were framed as somehow outside the core. Companies like Facebook and Google, for instance, have faced pressure to treat content moderators better. Somecontract workers have said they were underpaid and faced the worst of the Internet  hate speech, child porn, suicides, massacres  without adequate mental health support, leading to post-traumatic stress disorder. Companies say they work with third-party firms because it allows them to adjust to shifting demands around language and time zones and that they carefully choose partners who provide support for moderatorss mental health and well-being. Last year, gig companies like Uber, Lyft, Instacart, and DoorDash spent more than $200 million on a California ballot initiative to roll back the gains after state legislators approved Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which would reclassify certain gig workers as employees. After the win, Uber and Lyft said they planned to loudly advocate for similar policies at the federal level. And for years, critics have accused Amazon of underpaying and overworking its warehouse employees. Most of the companys 1.3 million employees work in its logistics operation, picking, packing or stowing goods. Those jobs can be mundane and strenuous, with workers walking many miles a day, moving package after package in the process with few breaks. The challenges came into sharp relief during the pandemic. Last October, the company disclosed that nearly 20,000 of its U.S. employees had tested positive, or had been presumed positive, for the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. And earlier this month, the company came under fire after it disputed claims that its productivity demands are so intense that workers routinely urinate in bottles because they cant take restroom breaks. After Twitter lit up with claims by workers, particularly drivers who work for companies that deliver packages for Amazon, that they have needed to urinate in bottles, Amazon apologized. The company acknowledged that its drivers, as well as those who deliver packages for other companies, often have trouble finding restrooms. Meredith Whittaker, one of the organizers of a 2018 walkout at Google, when 20,000 workers stepped out of their offices to protest the companys mishandling of sexual harassment allegations and other issues, said at the time that there was little recognition from Google leadership that organizing efforts might lead to efforts like the Alphabet Workers Union because the prospect seemed so foreign to Silicon Valley. Despite the historical antipathy toward unions, Whittaker said what executives fear is a shift in power: Theyre afraid of losing control, control of workers, control of workplaces. Now, workers at various levels of the tech hierarchy see parallels in their efforts and the vote in Bessemer, even if they have yet to win major victories. It mirrors in a lot of ways how we had to take on Shipt and Target, said Willy Solis, a labor organizer who helps run campaigns helping workers for Shipt, a grocery delivery app owned by Target through two worker-led groups, Shipt Shoppers and Gig Workers Collective. We have to operate in a way that allows us to take on corporate giants that could quash us at any moment.

            "content": "For a couple years, audio designer Christian Vasselbring had been collecting empty tobacco tins on his desk at work. Co-workers would ask why he was hoarding them, and he wasnt so sure himself. He just had a feeling that one day, theyd come in useful. That day came when he started working on Little Nightmares 2, a horror game by Swedish video game studio Tarsier. As the team built a hospital level, they inserted horrifying patients that looked like mannequins. They creak and squeak with every step as they try to grab the player. Vasselbring realized his collection of tins would be perfect to evoke that very specific sound, so he recorded himself clacking them together underneath a blanket. The most useful sounds were recorded with a bunch of cans, about 30 of them, lying in a big bed and me diving my hands into them while holding my breath, he said. Like many horror games, Little Nightmares 2 is effective because of its excellent sound design. Taking place in a nightmarish world, theres no dialogue and barely any on-screen text. Sound and art design do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to world building and evoking emotion. Because of that, finding the appropriate feel for sound effects, voices and ambiance required creativity and constant iteration. We have sounds everywhere in the game, so its never quiet, Vasselbring said. Theres always something going on in the background. These can be as subtle as the buzzing of flies or the dripping of water, to more aggressive enemy noises emanating from horrific, puppetlike villains. A violin bow was used on a mini guitar in the studio, for example, to create a grating sound during an early-game chase scene. Little Nightmares II made me dread every moment. I loved it. It can be tough to draw the line between music and ambiance in Little Nightmares 2, and thats intentional: The two bleed together, giving the world a distorted feel. Unlike the hospital mannequins, which were recorded in-house, the majority of sounds originate from a royalty-free library, which the audio designers then mix and edit together. Sometimes an audio clip can be as many as 20 sounds layered on top of one another. You take all these sounds and they are your building blocks, like ingredients that you cook and then thats your new sound, Vasselbring said. Among the most challenging tasks for the team was recording voices for all the characters. Tarsier didnt hire professional voice actors and instead looked internally. Even an AI lead designer used his voice for one of the protagonists, Six. The audio directors preferred it this way, giving them complete control over how these voices would sound. I think the weirdest thing is that all the voices from all the children in the game are from adults, senior audio designer Tobias Lilja said. We didnt record any children. Vasselbrings voice was used for the schoolteacher, a prominent enemy within the school level whose neck extends to an unnatural length as she searches for the player. Both Vasselbring and Lilja reflect that the neck was probably the hardest sound to get right, mostly because of the characters gender. Shes an older woman, so its hard to try to mimic that with my own voice, Vasselbring said. I ended up doing heavy processing on the sounds to mask that its actually a man, and also using more of the neck sounds to try to put the emphasis on the neck sounds instead. Sometimes, the schoolteacher (and other enemies) can be heard from far away, as you crawl through vents or navigate through long hallways. Depending on where you are, those distant sounds may reverberate differently, and theyre vague enough that it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what they are. To masterfully instill a sense of dread in the player, Vasselbring built an under-the-hood audio system that could simulate how different noises would sound in different spaces. It is essentially a way of building some kind of realism for how sound travels through doors and walls, to have that feeling that something is happening on the other side of the wall, Lilja said. But the sound departments job wasnt all doom and gloom. Theres a more playful, yet still unsettling, sound in a later level where an urban populace is addicted to watching television. As theyre glued to their screens, a psychedelic 1960s-inspired tune emanates from their TV sets. The songs placement is randomized, too, so each player may hear it at different intervals. That was a very fun part of [the project], because it felt much freer than a lot of the other sound design, Vasselbring said. Theres a certain mood and a darkness. But then with the TVs, it was like, Oh, now I can make all these happy songs and just crazy s---. Flash is dead. These games from the early 2000s hope to live on.

            "content": "A 26-year-old man from Minnesota was arrested Friday for his role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the building as lawmakers certified the 2020 presidential election results, federal authorities said. FBI officials said they arrested Jonah Westbury after gathering evidence that included videos posted on social media that showed the suspect inside of the Capitol building celebrating the moment. We made it. This is our house! he is seen saying in a video selfie recorded moments after throngs of rioters broke into the Capitol, the bureau said. We got pepper-sprayed, got abused  he continues, before the video abruptly ends. In a different video, also taken inside the Capitol, Westbury announces: First time in the Capitol. First time in the Capitol  Im proud of every  one of you, court documents show. Westbury faces charges of entering and remaining in restricted buildings, disorderly conduct in restricted buildings and in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building, according to the criminal complaint. It was unclear whether Westbury has a defense attorney. The FBI said that after the Capitol attack, the bureau received a tip from a high school classmate of Westburys who identified him in videos posted on the social media platforms TikTok and Snapchat, where he is seen narrating his incursion into the government building. The Snapchat video was then posted on a Twitter account of a friend of Westburys, according to court documents. FBI investigators identified Westbury in the videos and in an image posted on Reddit where he is seen wearing a gray sweatshirt and red hat taking a selfie inside the Capitol. The FBI said it also obtained additional video clips from Westburys own Snapchat account that show him inside the Capitol. Westburys arrest comes just a day after 39-year-old Victoria White, also from Minnesota, was charged with entering a restricted building, disorderly conduct in a restricted building, violent entry on Capitol grounds, impeding law enforcement officers from their duties and obstruction of justice. Three Minnesotans have been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack, which led to the deaths of five people. Last month, Jordan Stotts, 31, was arrested and charged with trespassing and violent entry into the Capitol and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Both White and Stotts posted messages and images on Facebook that showed their role in the riot, the FBI said. In a post written on Facebook, Stotts narrated his actions during the siege: It all started by scaling a wall as we broke into the U.S. Capital to strike fear into the sold out Congress. We were tear gassed and 2 people were shot. We were peaceful but the police were not, he wrote, according the FBI. He justified his involvement, claiming government attacks on his religious freedom and freedom of speech. They work for us and have no right telling us what we can and cant do! Im sick of it and so are the Patriots! he wrote in a different post, the FBI said. More than 300 people have been charged in the Capitol attack  deemed by prosecutors as unprecedented in its gargantuan scale both in terms of the volume of the evidence collected and the number of defendants. More than 100 federal prosecutors are working on cases across the country, and more than 900 search warrants have been executed. Investigators have collected evidence from more than 15,000 hours of surveillance and body-camera videos, 1,600 electronic devices and more than 200,000 tips, prosecutors said. The government said in a court filing March 12 that the case is likely to be the most complex investigation ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice.

            "content": "A Florida woman who, without wearing a mask, purposefully coughed on another customer in a Pier 1 store last year has been sentenced to 30 days in jail. Debra Hunter, 53, will serve time in Duval County jail, followed by six months of probation, an anger management course and a $500 fine for second-degree assault, a misdemeanor. Judge James A. Ruth said in theThursday sentencing that Hunters mid-pandemic actions on June 25 could have had deadly consequences for the victim, Heather Sprague  who was undergoing treatment after the removal of a brain tumor  or her family. The judge also said that although Hunter was extremely concerned about the well-being of her own family, who had been permanently scarred as a result of her actions, she showed little remorse for the trauma she inflicted on Sprague and her loved ones. Hunters attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sprague declined to answer questions after the sentencing. In video recorded by Sprague and shared widely on social media, Hunter is seen waiting at a Pier 1 checkout counter. Sprague was recording a heated argument Hunter was having with store employees. In the video, Hunter turned her attention to Sprague for recording her behavior with her cellphone. Do you really need this? What do you want to do, post it for you? Hunter said in a daring tone, then gestured at Sprague by holding up two middle fingers. Then Hunter walked toward Sprague and toldher what she was about to do  I think Ill get real close to you and cough on you. How about that? The video capturesHunter coughing on Sprague, calling her a derogatory name and then leaving the store with one of her children. Sprague, who has 10 children and was undergoing treatment for a brain tumor, told the court that some of her youngest children hadweak immune systems after experiencing neglect and abuse before their adoptions. The judge said he was unaware about the health of Spragues children until Thursday. Sprague said the cough, which sprayed spittle on her face,left her worried about her health and that of her family at a time when coronavirus tests were difficult to obtain. During the sentencing hearing, Hunter read aletter to the judge detailing how much her husband and three children had suffered because of what she did. Through tears and sniffles, Hunter explained how her social circle had shrunk and how her children had been ostracized by their peers. He was shunned by his classmates, who would boldly ask him and purposefully in the midst of a small crowd, if his mother was that lady in the video, she said of her oldest son. It was like he was the son of the woman who wore the Scarlet Letter. Hunter told the judge her family is permanently scarred from the fallout of the widely shared video but that her children should not have to suffer further. I often wonder what it would be like if every one of us, as the flawed human beings we are, had their worst moments reduced to a short video for all the world to see and judge, she said. The hardest part is that video shows me in the worst possible light on my worst possible day. In sentencing, Ruth focused on the potential impact Hunters saliva-spewing cough could havehad on Sprague and the lack of remorse or empathy for the way the attack affected her victim. I didnt hear much about your clients concern for the actual victim in this case, the judge said, addressing Hunters attorney. I havent heard about the potential deadly impact this could have had on all of them [Spragues family], not only because of covid, but someone who has cancer and a compromised immune system. The judgenoted Hunters daring tone in the video and her obscene gesture and said it negated her claim that shes been concerned about the social media consequences. Hunters six months of probation come with the understanding that she will be required to undertake mental health evaluations and follow-up treatments if a counselor deems appropriate. The judge added anger management to Hunters sentence,based on concerns about her parenting. Your behavior in the presence of the children is reason for me to believe that was not the only episode the children had witnessed also or had been exposed, he said. Hunter will start serving her time on April 19 with credit for one day served. She yelled an anti-Asian slur at a man on the street, police said. He was an undercover NYPD officer.

            "source": "Al Jazeera English",
            "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/10/almost-180-degree-turnaround-more-black-americans-open-to-covid-jabs",

            "content": "More Black people in the United States say they are open to receiving coronavirus vaccines, a new survey shows, an encouraging sign that one community leader described as almost a 180-degree turnaround from earlier in the pandemic. According to the late March poll by the Associated Press news agency and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about 24 percent of Black people said they would probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That is down from 41 percent in January, and is similar to the proportion of white people (26 percent) and Hispanic Americans (22 percent) who also say they do not plan to get jabs. The findings come as US President Joe Bidens administration works to speed up inoculations to try to outpace a recent rise in infections, after he promised that all adults would be eligible for a jab by April 19. Public health experts had raised concerns about the need to ensure that Black and other communities of colour in the US, which have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, had equitable access to vaccines. Local leaders said vaccine hesitancy was fuelled in part by decades of institutional discrimination in healthcare and other public services. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told AP that attitudes among Black people have taken almost a 180-degree turnaround as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. Benjamin said Black physicians, faith leaders and other organisers have helped get targeted messaging to the community in a way that wasnt preachy. They didnt tell people, You need to get vaccinated because its your duty. They basically said, Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family,' he said. Mattie Pringle, a 57-year-old Black woman from South Carolina who previously had doubts about taking the vaccine, said she changed her mind after a member of her church urged her to reconsider. She got her first jab last week. I had to pray about it, and I felt better after that, Pringle told AP. Medical and public health experts have continued to urge people in the US to get vaccinated in an effort to slow the spread of the disease, which has killed more than 561,000 people across the country  the highest death rate in the world. The US, which has reported over 31 million cases to date, has authorised three vaccines for emergency use: the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson jabs. So far, more than 178.8 million vaccine doses have been administered countrywide, while 68.2 million people are considered fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Recent surveys have shown that more Americans in general say they intend to get vaccinated than previously did. The Pew Research Center reported in early March that 19 percent of US adults said they had already received at least one dose, while another 50 percent said they probably or definitely would get vaccinated. Taken together, 69 percent of the public intends to get a vaccine  or already has  up significantly from 60 percent who said they planned to get vaccinated in November, it said. Other recent surveys show that attitudes towards vaccines are split along political lines. A survey at Monmouth University released last month found that 36 percent of Republicans said they would avoid the vaccine compared with just six percent of Democrats. That prompted top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, to call on former President Donald Trump to encourage his supporters to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, experts are urging Americans to take whichever vaccine is available to protect themselves and avoid delays. When people come in, I always advise them to get the vaccine thats available because you never know what vaccine is going to be available the next time, Reham Awad, a pharmacy intern in the Chicago area, told Al Jazeera this week. Biden administration wants to ramp up vaccination campaign as coronavirus cases rise due to COVID-19 variants. Some health workers worry that patients preferences for COVID vaccine brands could slow the rollout of jabs in the US. Armies of online volunteers have taken it upon themselves to help total strangers navigate myriad US vaccine systems. The Biden administration plans to help Michigan better administer the doses already allocated to the state."

Speaking at a news conference alongside Zelenskyy, Erdogan said he hoped the conflict would be resolved peacefully, through dialogue based on diplomatic customs, in line with international laws and Ukraines territorial integrity. Our main goal is that the Black Sea continues to be a sea of peace, tranquility and cooperation, Erdogan said. Zelenskyy said the views of Kyiv and Ankara coincided regarding the threats in the region and as well as responses to those threats. Erdogan stressed that Turkeys cooperation with Ukraine in the defence industry, which was the main item on the meetings agenda, was not a move against any third countries. Al Jazeeras Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said Ukraine was purchasing Turkeys military drones. She also said that new generation drones will be equipped with the Ukrainian engines. Zelenskyys visit to Turkey comes amid renewed tensions in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014. In a visit to troops there this week, Zelenskyy said breaches of a July truce were increasing. Separatist authorities have also accused Ukrainian forces of violating the ceasefire. Russia has reinforced its troops along the border and warned Ukraine against trying to retake control of the separatist-controlled territory. Kyiv rejects that it is preparing for an offensive. The Russian military buildup has raised concerns in the United States and Europe. The Turkish and Russian presidents spoke on the phone on Friday. Among the issues discussed was Ukraine. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin expressed concern that Ukraine recently resumed dangerous provocations on the contact line. Turkey is a NATO member. But Erdogan and Putin have forged a close personal relationship, sealing energy and trade deals. They have also negotiated for opposing sides in conflicts, including Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh. Erdogans office also said he would discuss with Zelenskyy the living conditions of Crimean Tatars, who have ethnic links to Turks. Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. There has been a sharp escalation in fighting and reports of a Russian troop build-up at the border. Meanwhile, Russia says it fears resumption of full-scale war in east Ukraine and could take steps to protect civilians. Survivors give grisly testimony of torture, executions at war camps in eastern Ukraines breakaway regions."

            "content": "At least two people have died in storms in the southern United States, authorities said on Saturday, as strong winds toppled trees, flipped vehicles and smashed homes and other structures across several states. A 27-year-old man was killed in St Landry Parish, Louisiana when a tornado struck a home, local television news outlet KLFY reported on Saturday. Seven other people were also injured, and several vehicles were damaged by the high winds. Another man, 48, was killed when strong winds partially crushed a mobile home on Friday in Caddo Parish, also in Louisiana, the local sheriffs office said. Strong winds were also reported in parts of Florida and Mississippi, ripping down power lines and damaging several buildings. Many people were saying, Hey, we know what to do. Sadly, weve been through it before, and they pulled together as a community, the mayor of Panama City, Florida, Mark Sheldon, told The Panama City News Herald local news outlet. In Orange Beach, on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, four-inch hail was reported on Saturday morning  near softball size, said the US National Weather Service for Mobile, Alabama. Looking back at records since 1950, this is only the second documented 4 hail report in the 20 counties the agency serves, it said on Facebook. The storms come just days after experts at Colorado State University warned that the US should prepare for a sixth year of above-average Atlantic hurricanes this season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. In a closely watched outlook published on Thursday, the forecasters said the country could see 17 named storms and eight hurricanes. We are forecasting a well-above-average hurricane season, said Colorado State research scientist Philip Klotzbach. Last year, the US saw a record 30 named storms. On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Climate Prediction Center also announced it had increased its averages for the Atlantic hurricane season, to 14 named storms and seven hurricanes, up from 12 and six previously. The centre said it made the change based on the most recent 30-year period on record, from 1991 to 2020. The increase reflects a very busy period over the last 30 years, it said in a statement, and may be linked to better observation tools or due to the warming ocean and atmosphere which are influenced by climate change."

            "content": "The Irish prime minister, Micheal Martin, warned against a spiral back into sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland on Saturday, after a week-long streak of unrest continued with 14 police injured in the latest night of clashes. Disorder sparked in pockets of Belfast  the capital of Northern Ireland  on Friday night with petrol bombs and masonry thrown at officers, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said. A car was also hijacked and set on fire and pushed towards police lines, as the total number of officers injured in the recent disorder reached 88. Elsewhere, police clashed with a crowd of 40 in the northern town of Coleraine and a man was charged with possessing petrol bombs in suspicious circumstances following disorder in Newtownabbey, a suburb north of Belfast. Saturday marks the 23rd anniversary of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which wound down the three-decades-long conflict over British rule in Northern Ireland which killed more than 3,600 people. We owe it to the agreement generation and indeed future generations not to spiral back to that dark place of sectarian murders and political discord, Martin said in a statement. There is now a particular onus on those of us who currently hold the responsibility of political leadership to step forward and play our part and ensure that this cannot happen. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said it has been a difficult and worrying week. This anniversary comes as a reminder of the responsibilities we all have, as well as what politics, determination and dialogue can achieve, he said. That is the spirit we need now. It is incumbent on all of us to support Northern Ireland in leaving its divisive past behind, said Britains Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis. The most bitter unrest in recent years has mainly emanated from the pro-United Kingdom unionist community. Resentment is simmering in some quarters over apparent economic dislocation due to Brexit and existing tensions with pro-Irish nationalist communities. After the UK left the EU at the start of this year, checks and tariffs were introduced on some goods moving from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland as the province now borders the bloc via EU member the Republic of Ireland. But critics of the departure deals Northern Ireland Protocol say a border is now in effect in the Irish Sea, leaving unionists, who want to stay in the UK, feeling betrayed. Brigid Laffan, director of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute, told Al Jazeera that the protocol has undermined the loyalist sense that London will take care of them. So unionists and loyalists feel more vulnerable now, and this then comes on top of a lot of socioeconomic problems in loyalist areas, she said. So what we are seeing in Northern Ireland today is very dangerous. The violence has also spread into the nationalist community. On Thursday night, nationalist rioters hurled petrol bombs, fireworks, bricks and bottles at ranks of armoured police vehicles preventing their advance to a unionist enclave. Officers deployed a water cannon for the first time in years and drove back the surging crowds late into the night. The previous evening, the gates in a peace wall separating unionist and nationalist neighbourhoods were set alight. Police said crowds from either side broke through to attack each other with petrol bombs, missiles and fireworks. On Friday marches had been planned in unionist communities in Belfast but they were cancelled following the news that Prince Philip  the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  had died. Protests are postponed as a mark of respect to the Queen and the Royal Family, a hastily erected placard in one unionist neighbourhood announced. While rioting on Friday was less pronounced than earlier in the week, there are fears it may gain new momentum in the coming days. Im worried about the weekend ahead, Michelle ONeill, Northern Irelands deputy first minister and leader of nationalist party Sinn Fein, told reporters on Friday. The statement comes ahead of the first meeting between President Joe Biden and Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin. Long-simmering tensions have been brought to the boil by Brexit. Nearly 100 years after partition, Brexit and demographic change are fuelling growing support for Irish unity."

            "content": "Libya has launched its delayed COVID-19 vaccination drive, with Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, prime minister of the countrys new unity government, getting his shot on live television. Officially, Libya has registered a total of about 167,000 coronavirus cases, including more than 2,800 deaths, out of a population of seven million. Its healthcare system has struggled to cope during the pandemic, strained by years of political turmoil and violence. After the vaccination of Dbeibah on Saturday at the headquarters of Libyas Centre for Disease Control on the outskirts of the capital, Tripoli, Health Minister Ali al-Zenati was next to receive a jab. Libya has so far received 200,000 doses of Russias Sputnik V vaccine, alongside more than 57,600 AstraZeneca shots, the latter delivered through the COVAX programme for lower and middle-income countries. Dbeibah urged fellow citizens to register online for their own vaccinations. He has earmarked the vaccination campaign as a policy priority, alleging that the delivery of the shots was hindered by outgoing authorities. The arrival of vaccines has been delayed by political, not financial, considerations, he said. Dbeibah was selected earlier this year through a United Nations-sponsored Libyan dialogue to lead the country to national elections in December. His government replaces two warring administrations based in Tripoli and the countrys east, the latter loyal to renegade military commander Khalifa Hafar. The rival authorities have given their backing to the new administration, adding to tentative hopes that Libya can exit a decade of crisis. The World Health Organization said on Thursday that two new variants of the coronavirus are present in Libya, which has lately been detecting about 1,000 new daily infections. No lockdown measures are currently in place, and while masks are obligatory in public places, the measure is widely flouted. I feel sorry that the vaccine arrived late in Libya after thousands were infected. But better late than never, shop owner Ali al-Hadi told Reuters news agency, adding that his wife had been sick with COVID-19 and recovered. Many Libyans fear the vaccination campaign could be marred by political infighting or favouritism after years of unrest. We hope the health ministry will steer away from political conflicts so that services can reach patients, said housewife Khawla Muhammad, 33. Fewer than two million COVAX doses were cleared for shipment to 92 countries in the developing world last two weeks. More than 100,000 doses of Russias Sputnik V COVID vaccine arrived at Tripolis Mitiga airport. Nightly curfews will vary depending on intensive care unit occupancy rates in various Colombian cities, president says. New unity government brings hope for stability, but challenges abound."

            "content": "Myanmars own ambassador to the United Nations has called for a no-fly zone and sanctions, as the international community puts more pressure on the military government to end a deadly crackdown and restore democracy, and as 83 people were killed, with dozens more reported dead early on Saturday. The United States and European nations pleaded for action at a meeting on Friday of the UN Security Council where a Southeast Asian summit on the crisis was taking shape, but the military leadership remained defiant and refused entry to a UN special envoy. Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who has passionately rejected the February 1 coup and brushed aside the militarys claims that he no longer represents Myanmar, told the Security Council that there has been a lack of adequate and strong action despite hundreds of deaths, including children. Your collective, strong action is needed immediately, said Kyaw Moe Tun, in virtual remarks as he sat before the Myanmar and UN flags. I strongly believe that the international community, in particular the UN Security Council, will not let these atrocities keep going on in Myanmar. The ambassador called for a no-fly zone to avoid further bloodshed caused by the military air strikes on civilian areas. He also asked for an international arms embargo and the freezing of bank accounts associated with members of the military and their families. All foreign direct investment should also be suspended until the restoration of the democratically elected government, the ambassador said. The diplomats call came as reports emerged of more deadly crackdowns in the country, with 82 people killed on Friday night and into Saturday morning during protests in the Bago division outside of the largest city of Yangon, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group and a domestic news outlet said. One person was killed in Tamu town in Sagaing region, the AAPP reported. According to Radio Free Asia, civilians were reportedly shot at using live ammunition as security forces started dismantling a barricade set up by the protesters. Several people were also reportedly taken by police without arrest warrants. More than 60 people were killed in Myanmar's Bago division Friday after security forces removed barricades set up by pro-democracy demonstrators at around 3:00 a.m. and began firing live ammunition and grenades at the crowd. Photos: RFA Burmese & Citizen Journalists pic.twitter.com/zFsPCpHlZX China and Russia wield veto power at the Security Council and generally oppose international sanctions, although Beijing  the top ally of Myanmars military  has voiced growing concern about instability in its neighbour. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said the military needs to feel the cost associated with its horrific actions after ignoring previous condemnation. Will the Council quibble over language in yet another statement or will we act to save the lives of the Burmese people? she said, using Myanmars former name, Burma. Estonia, a non-permanent member of the Council, called for work on a resolution that would include sanctions and an arms embargo. With violence rising and refugees flowing out of Myanmars borders, regional powers have also stepped up efforts to find a resolution. A long-mulled over summit on Myanmar of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will take place on April 20, Nathalie Broadhurst, Frances deputy ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council. Diplomats said that the meeting was expected to be in person in Jakarta, the headquarters of ASEAN, but that there were divisions within the 10-nation bloc. At one end, there are Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, who are in the mode of back off, theres nothing to see, its a question of internal politics,' one diplomat said, while Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia are open to a more active role for ASEAN. Another diplomatic effort faced immediate opposition from the military government, which refused to let in the UN special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, who is on a tour of Asian countries. We have not permitted this. We also have no plan to allow it at this moment, spokesman Zaw Min Tun told the AFP news agency. Burgener had sought face-to-face meetings with the military, as well as civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been detained since the coup. In a further sign of discreet but growing diplomatic outreach, there have been reports that China has opened contacts with the CRPH, a group representing the deposed civilian government. A foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing said China was in contact with all parties as part of efforts to restore stability. Just arrived in BKK for talks. I regret that Tatmadaw answered me yesterday that they are not ready to receive me. I am ready for dialogue. Violence never leads to peaceful sustainable solutions. pic.twitter.com/cPGy5hSmbZ At least 618 civilians have been killed in the militarys crackdown on protests and nearly 3,000 arrested, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners on Friday. The death toll does not include the estimated 60 people killed in Bago overnight and into Saturday. UN rights officials said the military is making increasing use of heavy weaponry including rocket-propelled and fragmentation grenades, heavy machine guns and snipers. The military insisted it was responding proportionately to what it said are violent protesters. Meanwhile, 19 people have been sentenced to death for allegedly killing an associate of an army captain, the military-owned Myawaddy TV station said on Friday, the first such sentences announced in public since the coup. The report said the killing took place on March 27 in the North Okkalapa district of Yangon, Myanmars biggest city. Martial law has been declared in the district, allowing courts-martial to pronounce sentences. Fighters from an alliance of rebel groups reportedly attack a police station in new escalation after the military coup. Spokesman refuses to provide timeline for a new election, says state of emergency could be extended by up to two years. Forty-three children have been killed in the two months since Myanmars military coup began on February 1. Anti-coup groups share radio frequencies, offline internet resources to circumvent internet curbs amid violence."

The accident happened in Fengyuan coal mine in Hutubi County on Saturday evening, when staff were upgrading the site, the official Xinhua news agency said. Rescuers had located 12 of the 21 trapped miners, broadcaster CCTV said, but it was unclear if they were all together. Rescue personnel were trying to pump water from the flooded shaft and have been piping air into the mine. Pipes were being laid but the pumping operation was going to be challenging, CCTV said. Mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record and enforcement of regulations is often lax. In January, 22 workers were trapped in a mine in east Chinas Shandong province after an explosion damaged the entrance, leaving workers stuck underground for about two weeks. Eleven men were pulled out alive, 10 died and one miner remained unaccounted for. In December, 23 miners died after being trapped underground in the southwest city of Chongqing  just months after 16 others died from carbon monoxide poisoning at another coal mine in the city."

            "content": "Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth reflects on the public reaction to the Duke of Edinburgh's death, and how next weekend's low-key funeral will be a poignant moment in the life of the Royal Family and the nation. I think the Duke of Edinburgh would have been pleasantly surprised by the reaction to his death. He was very much somebody who didn't really think about himself very much. In fact, he made it a policy not to talk about himself, and he was quite dismissive of how he was seen, and I don't think he gave it much thought. I think he couldn't have failed to be touched by it, particularly by the extraordinary international response. It's been striking that leaders from across the world have responded in the way they have. In a sense it's a reward for the fact that he travelled to more countries than any other member of the Royal Family ever. Although he didn't take compliments well and he was always wanting no fuss, saying let's keep this low key, I think he would have been gratified. I think the public reaction to the Duke's death reflects a couple of things. One is the people's affection for the Queen. In a sense what has struck people is the sudden realisation that the Queen is alone. She met Prince Philip in the 1930s, they fell in love in the 1940s, and were married in 1947, which is longer than most people have been alive, and now she is alone. So it's partly a sense of affection for the Queen and her loss. But this is also someone who has lived 100 years - he has been there all our lives, so people can pause and reflect on a whole century that has gone by. This is the phenomenon of someone who has always been there, and people have stopped to think that he always did what he was asked to do. He was asked to support the Queen and he did, and he turned up in the right uniform on the right day at the right time without fail, for more than 70 years. It reflects the success of the Duke of Edinburgh's Awards Scheme too. My grandson, when he heard the news yesterday, happened to be working for a charity in order to get his Duke of Edinburgh's Gold award. So the Duke of Edinburgh meant something to him, even though he's only 16. And the award scheme means that children and young people understand what he was about even though they could only see him as a very old man. I think it's surprised people seeing all the tributes, because he's been retired for three years. But people have also seen the news footage, and discovered a) how dynamic he was b) how good-looking and c) how active he was in so many areas over so many years, and that will have surprised many younger people. Another trait that has come to light is his wicked sense of humour. Some of his jokes would probably now seem politically incorrect, but of course it was the humour of somebody of his generation. My favourite joke of his - and I heard him say this - was: Whenever you see a man opening a car door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife. He could also be quite disconcerting to be with. I remember being at the last fundraising event I did with him at Buckingham Palace nearly 10 years ago when he was already in his 90s. I was speaking and he kept interrupting me, saying this is boring, heard that story before. But he did like to make people laugh and he succeeded on the whole. He knew he ran risks, that if he told too many jokes, once in a while one was bound to go wrong. But he was himself, and he'd say - there's not a lot I can do about it. As regards the funeral, in normal times we would have expected something a lot more elaborate. But he was really not looking forward to the fuss there would have been on his 100th birthday. So the pandemic has in a way come to his rescue, and it will be a much quieter, small-scale affair. It's still going to be televised, there will be the moment's silence before it begins. It'll be more poignant, though, because it will remind us that although he was a public man it won't be a public occasion. There would have been 800 people there, representing many of the charities with which he was involved. But that won't happen now - there will be 30 people, principally members of his family. He said to me more than once: \"We are a family.\" That's what it is, it's just a group of people when all's said and done, so I think it will very poignant, of course, to see the Queen alone and to see her children and grandchildren mourning the loss of a father and grandfather. In a way it makes it more powerful, as something people can relate to because it's a family gathering just like any other. There's a realisation that if we regard the Queen's reign as a success, and most people do, he is the joint author of it. People were interested in what Barack Obama was saying about the value of the monarchy - in a world where presidents and prime ministers come and go, to have had this couple there for all our lives is a phenomenon, and it's unsettling when it changes."

Officers were called to an address in the capital following a noise complaint and discovered a clandestine gathering, Paris police tweeted on Saturday. \"Guests [were] fined for non-compliance with health measures,\" the tweet said. It comes days after French police launched an investigation into alleged fine dining and parties in the city. Last week, private TV channel M6 broadcast an undercover film it said was from a hidden camera, showing diners enjoying caviar, champagne and truffles at two upmarket venues. In response to the report, French Interior Minister Grald Darmanin ordered a probe, saying that such gatherings - breaching Covid lockdown rules - would be \"totally unacceptable\". The latest incident occurred on Friday in the 19th arrondissement (district) of Paris and involved \"over 110 people\", police said. The undercover film broadcast by M6 on 2 April showed an unnamed private dining club in a \"smart district\" of Paris, where guests were told they could remove their masks.

Surging coronavirus cases in France have prompted a new partial nationwide lockdown amid fears that hospitals may become overwhelmed with patients. All schools and non-essential shops are shut and a curfew is in place from 19:00 to 06:00. France has recorded just over five million cases of Covid-19 and at least 98,202 deaths, Johns Hopkins University reports. The country has struggled with an EU-wide delay in the vaccine rollout, as well as several new strains of the virus."

            "content": "The gains. The pump. The changing room selfie. That sweet, sweet serotonin rush. There are lots of reasons to be excited about gyms re-opening in England from Monday - they've been closed all of 2021. Gyms in Scotland are due to re-open on 26 April, in Wales it's 3 May and it's not been announced when they'll be back in Northern Ireland. Marc McLaren is a gym manager and personal trainer in Manchester and is \"absolutely buzzing\" about things re-opening as English lockdown rules ease. He's expecting things to get pretty busy. \"I think everybody's raring to go now,\" he tells Newsbeat. But Marc's urging caution and says people need to know that they won't be able to pick up where they left off in 2020. \"I've already seen it on the group chats, online, on social media - people can't wait to get in and use this machine, that machine - everybody's got in mind what they're going to do,\" the PureGym manager says. \"But as hard as it is - and it will be the same for myself and the personal trainers - take it slow, easy.\" \"With us coming back after such a lay-off, everybody's in the same boat. Just take your time. You won't have the same intensity or weight you did last year.\" He says that even after a few session with lighter weights or less intensity than before, you'll still feel more of a burn that you'd get working out at home. And now, more than ever, it's important for gym-goers to warm up and cool down properly to avoid injury, he says. \"Lean on the team,\" he advises. \"Everybody's had extra training on safe ways of working and on returning to the gym after a long lay-off.\" Kitty Bates is on a countdown. The 21-year-old isn't your average gym-goer - she competes in Strong Women competitions and she's got seven weeks between gyms opening and her next one. \"I've got a small amount of kit that I bought in the first lockdown when we all kind of freaked out and all the prices went through the roof, so I have been able to train to some extent,\" she says. \"The gym I go to is not like a commercial gym. Everyone there is friends with each other. We all get along with both inside and outside the gym.\" And while she's managed to keep in touch and meet up with her gym friends, she has missed them yelling at each other. \"Getting to scream at them to get that last lift, pull up a deadlift, being there to support them, that kind of stuff - I've really missed the social aspect of it.\" Chris is missing the social aspect too, but he's also keen to get back to the physical changes and mental health benefits he gets from regular workouts. \"Going to the gym was time for me to kind of put my earphones in and cut out the world for an hour,\" says the 25-year-old. \"The gym was the way to start my day in a good mood so that I just feel better working through the day.\" Chris will be following Marc's advice and taking things really slow when he's back in the gym, especially since he's had problems with his lower back due to exercise before. \"I'm not in the mood to do that again. So I usually jog to the gym, that helps as a bit of a warm-up.\" He's got his gym schedule for the next few weeks worked out on a spreadsheet and during lockdown has been using weights his brother didn't want. If you're not ready to race back to the gym, don't worry. Most of the UK's big chains will continue the online service they provided during the past 12 months. David Lloyd believe members will use what's offered online as \"complimentary to their experience, rather than as a replacement.\" PureGym says it is \"confident that gyms and home workouts can co-exist\" in the future and will continue to provide all the online services it introduced during the pandemic. GymBox says it will continue to invest in its online classes as people return to its London-based spaces. For people worried about how three months without gym workouts has affected their fitness or muscle mass, Marc says it'll all come back quickly. \"Your body can get back to a state it has been in previously, and it will be easier than getting there originally,\" he says. \"Muscle memory is real.\" He says we all just need to \"graft and put the work in.\" \"But I think everybody's going to enjoy that now,\" he adds.

            "content": "As Ecuador grapples with the crippling social and economic impacts of Covid-19, its voters will choose on 11 April whether a left-wing technocrat and economist or a conservative banker-turned-politician is the most suitable president to lead them out of the crisis. Sunday's presidential run-off election is set to take place against the backdrop of one of the worst economic downturns in the Andean nation's history caused by a still-raging coronavirus pandemic that has so far claimed more than 17,000 lives. Eight of the country's 24 provinces, including the capital Quito and the largest city, Guayaquil, have been under a health emergency. In the shadow of this, Ecuador's citizens will decide whether they want the socialist policies of former minister Andrs Arauz, 36, who is a political protg of former left-wing President Rafael Correa, or the pro-market strategies of 65-year-old former banker Guillermo Lasso, a three-time presidential candidate. While some pollsters have predicted that Mr Arauz could win the deciding run-off with the same big margin - over 10% - with which he finished ahead in the 7 February first-round vote, others forecast a closer result. There was still considerable uncertainty about where the votes gained in February by the third-placed contender, indigenous leader Yaku Prez, would end up going in the April run-off. Mr Prez, who denounced \"fraud\" in the first round and demanded a recount, has refused to back either Mr Arauz or Mr Lasso and has called on his followers to cast blank votes on Sunday. If he is elected, Mr Arauz would become the country's youngest ever president at 36. He held several high-ranking posts, including heading Ecuador's central bank and leading the ministry of culture, during the 2007-2017 presidency of Rafael Correa, himself a prominent figure of the Latin American left. Mr Arauz's close links to the former president, who currently lives in Belgium and faces an eight-year prison sentence for corruption charges in Ecuador, has opened him up to allegations that he will rule as \"Correa's man\". While he did not shy away from using former President Correa's image to rally support on the campaign trail, Mr Arauz has insisted he will make his \"own decisions\" if elected president. In contrast, former businessman and banker Guillermo Lasso represents the country's business sector and has vowed to break away from the leftist policies of past administrations that he says have dragged Ecuador down. However, despite his criticisms of Rafael Correa and the current centrist administration of Lenn Moreno, Mr Lasso has been accused by critics of offering a continuation of the unpopular Moreno government, which has been badly battered by the intertwined health and economic crises. Whoever wins on 11 April will face an uphill task. According to Ecuador's central bank, the economy shrunk by 7.8% in 2020 and data from the National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC) showed that some half a million people remained unemployed as of January 2021. In addition to the economic turmoil, corruption accusations inside the health ministry led to an almost two-month delay in designing a national vaccination plan. Not surprisingly, both candidates have focused some of their immediate promises on how to tackle the health emergency. Mr Arauz has said his goal would be to vaccinate 2.5 million people a month through a free, nationwide vaccination plan which would require the hiring of close to 6,000 health workers. He has also promised some $3bn (2.2bn) in \"productive loans\" which he says would be mainly for entrepreneurs, young people, indigenous communities, women victims of violence and farmers. For his part, Mr Lasso has vowed to vaccinate 9 million Ecuadoreans in the first 100 days of his administration, and promised he would lead \"better\" direct negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies producing Covid-19 vaccines. On the economy, he has proposed an increase in the minimum monthly wage, to $500, as well as tax cuts for small businesses and the creation of a fund to stimulate entrepreneurship. On one topic at least, both Mr Lasso and Mr Arauz seem to agree: on the need to improve public safety amid rising homicides, and to counter the threat posed by drug-trafficking armed groups operating along the border with neighbouring Colombia and Peru. Both candidates have pledged to strengthen the military and police forces, with Mr Arauz placing his focus on respect of human rights, while Mr Lasso has called for \"more and better training\". They have also proposed more international co-operation to tackle the drug-trafficking groups."

            "content": "\"I've really missed shopping, museums too,\" says 74-year-old Brenda Allenby. \"I'll probably go to John Lewis, mainly to browse. It's just nice to have the opportunity to look around the shops again.\" After a devastating year for High Streets up and down the country, retailers are hoping for a huge boost this week. All non-essential shops in England and Wales will be able to welcome customers from Monday, more than three months after closing their doors. In Scotland, non-essential retail is due to reopen on 26 April, while in Northern Ireland, only contactless click-and-collect will be permitted for non-essential retail businesses from 12 April. Analysis firm Springboard is predicting almost a 50% uplift in footfall during the first week, followed by a further rise of 10% in the second. While some shoppers are eager to hit the High Street, others remain wary and say they will continue to shop online. As well as visiting the hairdresser and the beautician, Brenda will be heading to London's Oxford Street. She says she has bought a few things online over the last year, but prefers to go and look in person. \"There's a shop I like on Tottenham Court Road called Retro Revival which sells dresses, hats and shoes, so I'll have a look there. \"My daughter does everything online and always has. I'd rather see things and touch them.\" Kathy Crawford, 66, will be visiting Marks & Spencer as soon as it reopens on Monday and is willing to queue for as long as it takes to get in - something many shoppers faced when non-essential shops reopened last time. \"I just can't wait,\" she says. \"I haven't bought anything for a year. I'm absolutely desperate for the basics out of Marks, [things like] leggings and vests.\" Like many others, she has found the pandemic particularly isolating. She is retired and lives alone, so being able to do normal activities such as shopping cannot come soon enough. \"If I don't get out, I don't see anybody. The swimming pool has been closed and it's just been an absolute nightmare.\" She is also not a fan of online shopping: \"There are thousands of scams going on at the moment.\" Wary of some of the problems that shoppers faced after the last lockdown ended, the government has relaxed some rules for retailers. They will be allowed to open as late as 22:00 to help ease the problem of queues, although experts expect there will still be delays. Fitting rooms will also be allowed to open, as long as strict cleaning measures are followed. However, all shoppers will still be expected to wear face masks and follow social distancing rules. Sid Briggs, 19, is happy he'll be able to get back out and visit some of his favourite independent shops - many of which have struggled in the crisis. But the body piercing professional is also a bit wary about returning to the High Street. \"I'll try to avoid the crowds if it gets too busy. And I personally wouldn't use a changing room. Trying on things like jackets, I guess, are fine, but other than that, I'm just going to have to take the risk,\" he says. Caitlin Booton, 23, says she is in no hurry to get back to the shops. \"I don't think it's very clever to open the shops now and risk another wave, like what we're seeing in Europe,\" she says. \"I don't think we should rush into that. \"I still live with my parents as well, so I've got to watch it a bit.\" Research from Deloitte shows just over half (56%) of consumers feel safe returning to the High Street this week. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, says businesses have spent hundreds of millions of pounds to make shops Covid secure for customers and staff. John Lewis says it will have \"customer service hosts\" to manage customer numbers, while a new returns process will involve drop boxes and the quarantining of returned stock for 48 hours. Ikea says its safety measures will include a staggered entry system to enable social distancing, hand sanitiser facilities throughout stores and more frequent cleaning routines. For Gwen Lee, 56, and Jessica Ellery, 40, there are other things they are looking forward to more than shopping. From 12 April, holidaying is England is allowed again, subject to certain conditions, as long as it is in self-contained accommodation. So Gwen has booked a holiday cottage in Wiltshire for the week of 12 April. \"I'm looking forward to getting out of London and seeing somewhere else for a while,\" she says. Jessica Ellery says she is looking forward to visiting the hairdresser and eating out. However, she has been doing most of her High Street clothes shopping online since before the pandemic began and that won't change. \"I've been shopping at Asos and Oasis online during the pandemic. It's so easy because you just return anything by taking it back to the newsagent.\" High Street stores were already struggling with the shift to online shopping before the crisis began, and that trend has accelerated since last March. On top of that, the British Retail Consortium estimates that the three lockdowns have cost non-food stores 30bn in lost sales, leading to a number of retailers closing their doors for good. Ms Dickinson warns: \"While we expect an initial surge in spending when shops first open, the real test will be how this holds up in the weeks and months that follow.\" Last year, shop footfall returned to 70% of 2019 levels, according to figures from the British Independent Retailers Association. But boss Andrew Goodacre says the sector \"needs to do better than that\". \"The vaccine programme will hopefully make people feel safer and encourage more people to the shops. We need good weather and no more threat of lockdowns.\" When non-essential retail reopens this week, you will be totally within your rights in a store or a restaurant to put down a product and leave if you feel uncomfortable. If you're worried about lack of ventilation, long queues, or other shoppers getting too close, then don't feel that you have to stay. Just leave. Be careful around touchpoints. Many shops will provide hand sanitiser, but it's always useful to bring your own for any time you push a door handle, pick up a trolley, or rake through a clothes rack. Hang on to your receipts. For lots of us, changing rooms might still feel a little too uncomfortable, so if you're buying without trying, then keep the receipt and check with the store. Most will offer you a refund, exchange or credit note if you return it within 28 days."

            "content": "Dubai is gearing up to host the World Expo - a year after it was originally supposed to be held. Held every five years, expos see hundreds of countries using pavilions to show off the latest in architecture and technology. Before the pandemic forced the event to be postponed, organisers had expected 25 million visits during the course of the six-month international fair. It will now run from 1 October to 31 March 2022. However, despite restrictions on travel, and the recent lockdowns in some parts of Europe, Reem Al Hashimy, managing director of the Dubai Expo 2020, says they are holding on to the pre-pandemic target. \"The world has gone through these galactical shifts over the last year but now with vaccines being rollout, we believe that situation will settle by October. We believe the situation will be far more positive by then.\" It is an optimistic forecast for an event that relies on tourism, when most of the world has cutdown on international travel. But the various in-person conferences and trade shows held in the city over the last few months has made organisers more hopeful. Organisers are also expecting the vaccination rates to gather pace globally during the summer - which would give people the confident to start making international trips again. Dubai Expo is being billed as the biggest event to be held in the Arab world. For the UAE, the showpiece event comes at a time when it is trying to recover from one of its worst recessions in five decades. Last year, the economy contracted by 6.6% even as the government announced a series of reforms to attract investment and help businesses. Some of those steps have started to show results with the International Monetary Fund upgrading the growth outlook for the UAE to 3.1% for 2021. The authorities are pinning their hopes on the World Expo to attract tourists in large numbers that would help accelerate economic recovery. Billions of dollars have been poured into the project since the UAE won the bid to organize the international fair in 2013. The site covers 4.3sq km, or 613 football pitches, and the expo will have its own metro station The spectacle is particularly crucial for the Middle East's financial hub - Dubai - as its economic model relies heavily on sectors that are driven by consumer spending, like hospitality, luxury retail and travel. While most experts think it might challenging to achieve 25 million visits, there is a broad consensus that millions will attend the event, which could have a significant impact on the economy. \"Even if the event is partially successful it has the potential of reviving the economy and taking it back to the pre-pandemic levels\" says Scott Livermore, chief economist for the Middle East at Oxford Economics. More than 190 countries will participate in the Expo - showcasing innovations around the themes of sustainability, mobility and opportunity. In February, the Tokyo Olympics committee announced that they would go ahead with the event in July regardless of the how Covid-19 situation evolves. Like the Japanese, the Dubai Expo organisers also have no plans of postponing or cancelling the event. 'We are applying all the necessary safety measures as mandated by the WHO and following other best practices to allow the event to take place in a safe environment' says Ms Al Hashimy. She also adds that there is a need for people to converge to discuss the next steps to tackle global challenges like the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Expo offers that platform. Dubai is famous for being home to the tallest building in the world and its white sand beaches. It has transformed itself from a desert backwater port into a thriving financial and tourism hub within a generation. But the World Expo is the most ambitious project for the country. The event is also at the heart of UAE's plans for diversifying its economy - away from oil. Dubai also been one of the few cities to keep its economy open since July last year when most of the world was under lockdown. Covid-19 cases remined low during the second half of 2020 but daily infections in the country quadrupled to almost 4,000 a day towards the end of January this year, primarily due to the influx of tourists into Dubai during the winter holiday season. The infection rate has fallen since then after authorities tightened restrictions at indoor venues but steered away from imposing a lockdown. To prevent another wave, fresh restrictions have been issued for Ramadan that starts next week - a month during which Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. Despite the recent wave, the UAE has managed to rollout the vaccines at a rapid pace, with more than 62% of the population inoculated. It ranks second globally behind Israel for doses administered per 100 people. The UAE aims to be one of the first countries to vaccinate most of its population and return to complete normalcy. This would also help in positioning it as a safe tourist destination. 'If the UAE is able to achieve herd immunity then that would be a big positive for the Expo as it would be able to attract many more tourists, especially during the second half of the event\" says Mr Livermore."

            "content": "The movie Ma Rainey's Black Bottom has won two prizes on the first night of the Bafta Film Awards, which are being split over two days for the first time. Many of the technical prizes were handed out on Saturday, with the main awards still to be presented on Sunday. Riz Ahmed, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Vanessa Kirby and Daniel Kaluuya are among the stars up for acting awards. Both halves of the ceremony are being presented from the Royal Albert Hall, but winners are appearing virtually. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom stars Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman as members of a 1920s blues band. Other winners included Rocks, a low-budget British film starring a group of teenage girls, many of whom had not acted before; Christopher Nolan's time-bending thriller Tenet; and Mank, in which Gary Oldman plays Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. Noel Clarke - the Kidulthood, Bulletproof and Doctor Who actor - was also presented with the outstanding British contribution to cinema award. He dedicated it to \"my young black boys and girls out there that never believed it could happen to them\". The Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. Host Clara Amfo paid tribute to Prince Philip, who was Bafta's first president from 1959-66. On Sunday, prizes including best film, director, screenplay and animated feature will be handed out, as well as the acting awards. This year's shortlists include a diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors. This time, 16 of the 24 acting contenders come from minority ethnic backgrounds. Two films lead the overall field with seven nominations each - Rocks and Nomadland, which stars Frances McDormand as a US woman living a nomadic life in a van after the financial crash. While the nominees will all appear remotely on Sunday, stars including Hugh Grant, Tom Hiddleston, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and Phoebe Dynevor will be at the London venue to announce the winners. They will be joined by fellow award presenters Chiwetel Ejiofor, Cynthia Erivo, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Richard E Grant, Felicity Jones, Asim Chaudhry, James McAvoy, David Oyelowo, Pedro Pascal and Jonathan Pryce. Rose Byrne, Andra Day, Anna Kendrick and Renee Zellweger will announce some winners from Los Angeles. Sunday's ceremony will be hosted by Edith Bowman and Dermot O'Leary, and will be broadcast on BBC One from 19.00-21.00 BST. Following the lack of diversity last year, a seven-month review led Bafta to introduce more than 120 changes to its voting, membership and campaigning processes. They included the introduction of a new longlist round of voting, the expansion of the outstanding British film field to 10 nominations, and increasing all four acting categories and best director to six nominees in an attempt to ensure greater diversity. This year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Oscars. Unlike the Baftas, the Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person, and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders. Facebook@BBCNewsEnts.

            "content": "A county that was one of the hardest-hit regions in the UK during the second wave of the pandemic now has the lowest case and positivity rates in Wales. Public Health Wales data shows 4.1 people per 100,000 of the population in Bridgend have tested positive for the virus in the past seven days. At its peak over the Christmas period that figure was 1,118.7. In December Bridgend had the second-highest case rate of Covid in Wales, behind only Merthyr Tydfil. In the week leading up to 20 December - when Wales imposed strict lockdown measures - both areas had case rates almost double the Wales average. Case rates have been falling substantially in Wales since January. Robert Morgan, a Bridgend-based GP, said despite a \"challenging\" year, his experience was that people had been following the rules as best they can. \"It's been very challenging for patients throughout the year. My experience is, in a majority of cases, patients have been trying to grasp what the rules mean to them and then tried to stick to them. \"Once this virus gets in an enclosed space, it's going to spread, and it really doesn't take a lot of people to actually facilitate that spread.\" The turnaround since January has been substantial, with the case rate in Bridgend remaining lower than the Wales average since the start of February. In the most recent week of data the case rate for Bridgend was 4.1, the lowest in Wales. The positivity rate was also the lowest in Wales, indicating only 0.5% of tests carried out returned a positive result. The World Health Organization recommends the positivity rate should be lower than 5% for a stable period before any restrictions are eased. Every area of Wales is now under that 5% threshold. Despite the improvement, there was a long way to fall to reach the current levels, with many lives lost. While case numbers in Bridgend started to fall towards the end of December, death figures continued to rise into January. Helen Foley, a GP in the area, said: \"One of the care homes we worked with lost most of their clients. We lost a lot of the elderly patients over the winter, which was really really tragic. \"It's pretty devastating to have that happen to your local community. They're obviously all people with families with lives and it's really upsetting.\" Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, which only includes deaths in which Covid was officially recorded as the main cause, show the mortality rate in Bridgend rising to one of the highest in the UK during January. There were 159 Covid deaths recorded there in January, more than any other authority in Wales, without even taking into account population differences. The area accounted for more than half of the 303 deaths in Wales during the month. The ONS uses a different method to calculate their death rates, so although they are not comparable to previously stated case rates, they can be used to compare Covid deaths in different areas. The death rate in Bridgend during January was 1,277, more than double the all Wales rate of 539. This was the ninth-highest rate in England and Wales, out of the 365 local authority areas. As Covid rates fall in Bridgend, and across Wales, one of the priorities is now dealing with issues people have not been able to visit the doctor for. Dr Foley said: \"Covid work has reduced significantly, it's left us to actually start being able to deal with the things people haven't been seeing us about for months and months. \"I think there's going to be huge knock-on effect with general health, both physical and mental, and that's all just starting to come through now that things are much calmer and settled.\""

            "content": "Former Big Brother star Nikki Grahame has died at the age of 38. The TV personality had checked into a private hospital last month as she fought an eating disorder. In a statement to the BBC, Grahame's manager confirmed \"with immeasurable sadness\" that Grahame died on Friday morning. \"Please respect the privacy of Nikki's friends and family at this tragic and difficult time,\" he added. Former Big Brother presenter Davina McCall led the tributes, tweeting: \"I am so desperately sad to hear about Nikki Grahame. My thoughts are with her friends and family xx she really was the funniest, most bubbly sweetest girl.\" the BBC Action Line and the charity Beat Eating Disorders. Grahame, originally from Northwood in north-west London, took part in the seventh series of Big Brother in 2006. She became known for her tantrums, particularly in the Diary Room. Grahame would often complain to Big Brother about the conditions in the house or fellow contestants, famously shouting \"It's so cold,\" and, on another occasion, asking \"Who she?\" after a new housemate joined the show. She was hugely popular with viewers, and was voted back into the house four weeks after she was first evicted. She subsequently finished in fifth place. Speaking to The Guardian last year, Grahame said: \"I hold fond memories of Big Brother, even though there were times where it looked like I was having a meltdown. \"Those meltdowns really were me, though. What you see has always been what you get - I can't be any other way.\" After her appearance on Big Brother, she won a National Television Award for most popular TV contender. Grahame returned to the house in 2010 to take part in Ultimate Big Brother, the final series of the show to be broadcast on Channel 4. The show saw several popular Big Brother contestants from over the years return to take part in one final series, before it moved to Channel 5. Grahame finished in second place. By this time, she had developed her career as a popular TV personality, and starred in her own reality TV series called Princess Nikki. She also guest-starred on programmes such as the Friday Night Project and as a contestant on celebrity editions of shows such as Pointless and The Weakest Link. Prior to finding fame on Big Brother, Grahame was an aspiring actress. She appeared as an extra in the BBC's EastEnders and played a footballer's wife in Sky One's Dream Team. Grahame also appeared as a contestant on ITV's Blind Date and competed in the 2004 Miss Hertfordshire pageant. She continued her relationship with Big Brother, returning for 2015's \"Time Warp\" twist on Channel 5, and made a cameo in the final series of Big Brother in 2018. She also appeared as a \"wildcard\" housemate in the 2016 series of Big Brother Canada. Grahame's battle with anorexia was well documented, and she released a book about her eating disorder in 2009. Last month, a fundraising page was set up, asking fans to donate towards her recovery. It eventually raised more than 65,000. The page said the 38-year-old was in \"a very bad way\" and needed treatment in a rehabilitation centre. Several Big Brother figures including former winner Rylan Clark-Neal retweeted the appeal for donations. On Saturday, the page was updated to announce the news of Grahame's death. \"It breaks our hearts to know that someone who is so precious was taken from us at such a young age,\" it said. \"Nikki not only touched the lives of millions of people, but also her friends and family who will miss her immensely.\" Paying tribute to Grahame on Twitter, Clark-Neal wrote: \"Thinking of [Grahame's mother] Susan and Nikki's close friends and family. A Big Brother Icon.\" TV presenter Paddy McGuinness added: \"Definitely one of the stars from the glory years of reality TV. I met her a long time ago and she was a lovely girl. RIP young lady.\" Channel 4 tweeted: We are desperately saddened by the tragic news about Nikki Grahame and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Nikki's family and friends.\" Big Brother Canada added:\"Our hearts break for the loss of Nikki Grahame. Nikki will forever be a beloved part of the Big Brother family. Rest in peace.\" Nikki Grahame was a much loved housemate and a huge part of the Big Brother family. We are shocked and saddened by this awful news and our thoughts are with her family. pic.twitter.com/31wojcWI6F Facebook@BBCNewsEnts.

The family-owned company has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to run the process, according to people familiar with the matter. There is no guarantee the company will ultimately be sold. The process is at an early stage, the people said, with some adding that an IPO or minority investment is also a possibility. Northfield, Ill.-based Medline is likely to attract private-equity bidders, partly because industry players could struggle to swallow such a big rival, the people said. Blackstone Group Inc., KKR & Co. and Carlyle Group Inc. are among those expected to consider bids, some of the people said, and they could ultimately partner up given the size of the deal. The possible deal is the latest sign of a renaissance under way for large leveraged buyouts, which largely disappeared in the wake of the financial crisis as firms eschewed pairing up and taking on the mountains of debt such deals require. With risk tolerance rising broadly and private-equity investors sitting on mountains of unspent cash, the firms have been testing the waters lately on megabuyouts again, including at Royal KPN NV and Toshiba Corp.

Seven freaking over, he grumbled. His mood didnt get much better over the next two holes. On the par-3 sixth, an enormous cheer came out for the other player in his grouping, Matt Jones, who barely missed a hole-in-one. Then, with DeChambeau on the seventh tee box, he was interrupted by an even bigger cheerCorey Conners actually aced the sixth right behind him. Thats how its been here for Bryson DeChambeau. Golfs biggest hitter, and the sports most intriguing player to many, just cant solve the course he wants to figure out more than any other. I dont think you can ever figure this place out, DeChambeau said this week. DeChambeau is now 2-over par through three roundsplacing him squarely out of contention on a leaderboard led by Hideki Matsuyama, who is 11 under and four shots clear of the field. Others were able to score, too. Matsuyama was followed by 36-hole leader Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele, Marc Leishman and Will Zalatoris, a 24-year-old American playing in his first Masters. Zalatoris, like DeChambeau, is a powerful driver. Unlike DeChambeau, he has been able to make quick work of this course and decipher Augusta National. Its something DeChambeau has been trying for years. DeChambeau has taken this sport by storm with his brazen approach to supersizing his own game and dedication to analytics. He spent the pandemic putting on weight in order to help him absolutely bomb golf balls. It worked. He led the PGA Tour in driving distance last year and again this year. He took the sports bomb-and-gouge strategy to an extremehitting fairways was optional when he could blast it so far. Then he won the U.S. Open because of his approach. The newfound success and bold strategy, along with a swing thats jarringly violent, made this college physics major an object of fascination in the sport. Meanwhile, theres one place DeChambeau has always been fascinated with. It also happens to be the same course thats tormenting him. On his first visit here, he gazed in awe when he saw the old irons of Bobby Jones, the golfing legend who founded the course. Joness irons were all the same length. One of DeChambeaus peculiarities is he is the rare golfer who uses single-length irons these days. His win in the U.S. Open, combined with his obsession with the history here, made him golfs buzziest golfer ahead of the 2020 Masters last November. Yet he finished tied for 34th. He has never finished better than tied for 21st hereand that came in 2016, his debut, when he was the low amateur. He has become one of the best golfers in the world since then, earning millions, yet he has never topped his performance from when he wasnt even paid big bucks to play. This week added more frustration for DeChambeau. He was 4-over after the first round before making noise on Friday to get to 1-under. Then he gave that back with a double bogey and bogey on the 4th and 5th. He birdied three holes on the back, but also added a bogey and another double. Yet in a strange way, his struggles here make an odd amount of sense. Augusta National is a course that cant simply be beaten with distance. Rose, who led after the first two rounds, ranks 74th on tour in average driving distance. And the unusual rules here also tame DeChambeaus data-based insights: green books, that provide detailed breakdowns of the slope and break on every green, arent allowed at the Masters. Its why theres a crowded leaderboard with a wide range of playing styleswithout DeChambeau. Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com Copyright 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It signifies the changing of the guard within the monarchy and the nation more broadly from the generation that lived through that conflict and whose life arc encompassed the U.K.s imperial zenith as well as its loss of empire and a shrinking global role. Queen Elizabeth, the princes wife, remains on the throne, approaching her 95th birthday and apparently in good health. But Philips death severs one prominent link with what many Britons see as a heroic past and has provided the monarchy and the country with a chance to reflect on the future. Prince Charles, heir to the throne, is a different character from his direct and forceful father. He is taking over management of family affairs and, increasingly, moving into roles that have so far fallen to his mother. The country, just out of the European Union, is finding where it fits on the world stage. In some ways, Prince Philip, who was 99 years old, was a vestige of an earlier era that predated World War II, one in which the royal families of Europe intermarried. Born a prince of Greece and Denmark, he was, like his wife, descended from Queen Victoria. 1-800-Flowers.com: 1800 Flowers promo code: Get 25% off Mother's Day gifts Suez Canal Ship Is Freed.

Now authorities have to motivate a population that feels little urgency to get vaccinated by using a mix of social pressure, incentives, education and coercion. While surveys show vaccine acceptance remains high, the motivation to go out and get inoculated is lagging in the worlds second-largest economy given low infection rates. Chinas public health officials say the aim is to get 40% of the population vaccinated by summer. With the country administering more than 4.5 million shots a day in the past week, 161 million had been given by the end of Friday, according to the National Health Commission. Oxford University data-tracking project Our World in Data said about 11% of Chinas population had received at least one dose. That is a long way from herd immunitywhich would require about 80% coverageand compares with about a third of the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another challenge for China is the low efficacy rate of its vaccines currently in use. Preliminary data suggest that they range somewhere between 50% to 80%. To optimize the protection rate, China was looking into, for example, adjusting the dosage, adding an extra shot or changing the interval between injections, George Gao, director of Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Saturday.

Where can Asian Americans like me call home?Selina Wang (left) and her sister celebrate her grandmother's birthday at her relatives' home village in Henan, China.Last summer, a Chinese man approached me on a crowded Beijing street and asked me in Mandarin if I was Chinese American. It seemed innocent enough, as I was speaking English with expat friends. But after I nodded, he switched to English and bellowed \"go back to where you f**king came from\".These stinging words are familiar for Asian Americans living in the United States. But it was jarring to hear the phrase shouted at me in China. In the moment, I let out a laugh: As a Chinese American, I have now been told to get out of each country for the other. It was a moment of realization that regardless of where I go, I will always be a foreigner. I was born and raised in America, but over the past few years, I've lived in Beijing, Hong Kong and now Japan -- where the majority of people I'm surrounded by look like me and assume I'm a native. At first, that gave me an inexplicable -- albeit superficial -- sense of belonging that I never felt in America. In the US, my answer to the constant question \"where are you from?\" is never enough. When I say America, it's almost always followed by: \"But where are you really from?\" Countless times I've been asked why I can speak English \"without an accent.\" And Asian American women's experiences of racism are inextricably linked to misogyny. We've had nearly every part of our bodies (eyes, hair, feet, mouths, skin, and even private parts) appraised on the basis of our race. Our personalities are assumed by strangers to be subservient. Selina Wang with her grandmother at her relatives' home village in Henan, China. Recently, as US-China tensions have ratcheted up, with rhetoric from both sides turning toxic, I've also faced animosity in China for being American. Chinese state media has fueled anti-American nationalism, calling the US the \"enemy of the world\" at the height of the US-China trade war. Meanwhile, in America, roughly nine-in-10 adults consider China a competitor or enemy, according to a Pew survey. \"There's this consistent theme that when there are tensions with an Asian country, people who are Asian American or who look Asian American are often scapegoated,\" Christopher Lu, former Cabinet Secretary to Barack Obama, said on CNN.The irony is that often Asian Americans have a traumatic, complex, or even non-existent relationship with the distant country they're held accountable for. My parents immigrated from China to the US for graduate studies before I was born. Later, my grandparents, who had been farmers in China, came to America to help care for my sister and me. They weaved pieces of their Chinese lifestyle into the fabric of our suburban American home, doing what felt most familiar to them. They turned our yard into a vegetable garden, using the produce for dumplings and other Chinese comfort foods. Home comforts: dumplings made by Selina Wang's grandmother in Henan, China.My grandparents never had the opportunity to go to school. They taught themselves how to read and write Chinese, and proudly passed their knowledge to their grandchildren. Chinese became my first language. I could barely speak English when I started pre-school. My mother became concerned about my thick Chinese accent, so we started to speak English more at home. From there, I only became more self-conscious of my \"Chinese-ness.\" By elementary school, I asked my parents to stop packing Chinese food for lunch. I only wanted PB&Js after getting teased for bringing brown-colored tea eggs -- one of my favorite foods -- to class. The other kids thought they were rotten eggs. Moments like these made me long to be seen as the American that I am. My family, their traditions, and those of other Asian Americans in my community were part of the America I knew -- a melting pot of cultures. In fact, it was China that felt foreign. During each annual summer trip there, I felt like a tourist, and deep down, I wanted to be treated as such. I was so proud to be an American. But with each visit, I'd learn more about my family history and witness China's rapid development. Selina and her sister with their grandparents in the US. First, we would visit my father's village in the countryside, and he'd show my sister and me the mud hut he had once called home. He would often remind us that during the Cultural Revolution, my grandmother had to water down a single portion of porridge every day to feed six people. Then we would visit my mother's family in Hubei province. More than a dozen of us would cram around a tiny table, eating bowls of sesame noodles, while her family would recount different memories of trauma, fraught with political persecution and suicide. More Videos ...My family told stories of poverty and oppression as though they were simple childhood memories. For my sister and me, they were allegories with a single lesson: we should be grateful to be born in the US -- a free, tolerant, and wealthy society. As immigrants, they would say, upward mobility can only come by putting your head down and outworking the rest. Throughout the years, however, I began to notice the gap narrow between my relatives' lives in China and mine in the US. Villagers in my father's countryside town slowly gained electricity, running water, cars, and phones. My cousins in the city no longer wanted clothes from America as gifts -- they liked the styles in China more. In fact, there was almost no material possession we could bring from America they couldn't already find in China. Yet as their physical quality of life improved, their access to information worsened, as the Chinese government tightened internet controls and censorship. And as the pandemic spread around the world, the news they read differed more and more from mine. Green thumb: Selina Wang's grandfather in the family's yard, which they converted into a vegetable garden.I was living in Beijing when the coronavirus outbreak began, reporting on cases of a mysterious new pneumonia in Hubei province in December 2019. My cousin, a nurse, was working on the front lines at ground zero of the pandemic near Wuhan. We stayed in contact, as she worked long shifts without enough protective equipment, feeling the angst of being separated from her newborn son and family. My other relatives were under strict lockdown for months, facing pandemic-induced fear and anxiety. The same stress we all now know. When the pandemic reached the US, my mother called me to say she desperately wanted to wear a mask outside. One of our close family friends had died of Covid-19 in Wuhan early in the pandemic, and my mother was certain the virus was far deadlier than most believed at the time. But she feared being discriminated against as \"the Chinese lady who has Covid-19.\" At the same time, my Asian American friends were telling me they had been spat on, yelled at in the street, and even verbally attacked in restaurants for \"bringing the virus to America.\" More Videos ...Meanwhile, China and America engaged in a war of words over the pandemic. Then US President Donald Trump routinely called Covid-19 the \"China virus\" and \"kung flu\", fanning racism and hatred that fueled attacks on Asian Americans. The Stop AAPI Hate advocacy group has tallied more than 3,795 reported incidents of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US during the pandemic, including the killings of six women of Asian descent at Atlanta spas, which triggered rallies across the country. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said China represents America's \"biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century,\" as the only country with enough power to challenge the current international system. Meanwhile, since 2010, China has been calling for a \"new model of major-power relations.\" A dirt road cuts through fields at Selina Wang's relatives' home village in Henan, China.The difficult question for America's leadership now is how to effectively confront Beijing, without worsening discrimination at home against people who look Chinese. That means making clear distinctions -- for the public -- between the Chinese Communist Party, the 1.4 billion people in China, and millions around the world of Chinese heritage. More Videos ...\"For as long as Asian Americans have been in this country, we've been treated as outsiders, as people who can't be trusted,\" said Lu, the former Cabinet Secretary. \"You can go all the way back to the 1800s with Chinese railroad workers, to Japanese American internment during World War II, to the Korean and Vietnam Wars and to rising trade tensions with Japan in the 1980s.\" As I see conversations between leaders of the world's two largest economies descend into childish bickering, I can't help but think about all the Asian American lives uprooted or lost as a result of geopolitical disputes that are out of their control. I also think about the younger me, who just wanted to be accepted as American, and how hopeless she'd feel to know that, even today, she would be seen as the \"other\" -- no matter where she goes.

            "content": "President Joe Biden is pushing his infrastructure bill, the American Jobs Plan. This bill strays from what has helped him maintain an approval rating above 50% so far during his presidency because, even though the plan polls fairly well, it's not clear that Americans actually think it's all that important. Numerous polls have asked Americans about their priorities and infrastructure comes out low. Just 32% said improving the country's roads, bridges and public transportation systems should be a top priority for Biden and Congress, according to a January Pew Research Center poll. That ranked second to last among 19 items asked about in the poll. For comparison, strengthening the economy and dealing with the pandemic were first and second, respectively. A January Monmouth University poll came to a similar finding. It tested 15 areas for the federal government to address, and a mere 17% said transportation and energy infrastructure was extremely important. That was dead last in the poll. Again, the pandemic and the economy were at or near the topic of the list. Now, this isn't to say the infrastructure plan will necessarily hurt Biden's popularity. Right now, more Americans support than oppose the bill. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken last week showed that 45% backed the bill, while 27% opposed it. A lot of folks (28%) simply were undecided. An average of polls on the topic does find support a bit higher, with 54% favoring the bill to 23% opposing it. Nearly a quarter of the electorate was neither in favor nor opposed. A 54% opening favorability for a bill is good, but it's not close to the type of support Biden was getting for his coronavirus relief package. It's also about equal to Biden's overall job approval rating of around 55%. Among these same pollsters, Biden's Covid relief bill was far more popular than he was, with an average of 66% support to 19% opposition, with just 15% undecided. The higher number of undecideds in the infrastructure bill makes sense. Unlike with coronavirus relief, infrastructure is not at the top of most Americans' minds. The higher number of undecideds may also be an indication that opinions on the subject may be less entrenched than they were when it came to Biden's Covid relief bill. Moreover, the data suggests that those who are undecided are disproportionately Republican. This could mean that opposition might jump up as Republicans speak out against the bill. The good news for Biden is he may not need any GOP votes to pass his infrastructure package. Democrats control the House, and the Senate parliamentarian is of the belief that they could potentially use reconciliation (i.e. needing a simple majority of Senate votes) to pass future bills. If they are able to use it for the infrastructure bill, Democrats have the votes in the House and Senate, as long as they don't have any defections. That's why it'll be important to watch more moderate Democratic senators to see whether they waver.The lack of import that most voters are putting on infrastructure could work to their advantage. If most Americans aren't basing their votes on whether this infrastructure bill passes or not, there's likely a better chance that Democrats will toe the party line on a package important to the President."

            "content": "President Joe Biden meets with Vice President Kamala Harris, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. As they chart the country's tentative economic recovery, White House officials see possibility in the wake of the pandemic -- an opportunity to dive full bore into pursuing the most transformative progressive policies in decades. Holed up in offices in the cavernous Eisenhower Executive Office Building, top White House economic officials are combing through reams of data from the dramatic emergency measures deployed to address the dual economic and public health crises created by the pandemic, the kind of real-time information progressive economists have only been able to dream about during past economic downturns. They contend that data shows their policy priorities are having a tangible effect -- and that it helps make the case for doubling down in the form of a massive infrastructure and jobs package, even if Republicans aren't on board. It's not just that the series of unprecedented measures implemented over the course of the last year, punctuated by President Joe Biden $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, are helping to address the pandemic, though that's what the numbers show, said Charlie Anderson, director of economic policy and budget for Biden's Covid-19 response team.\"But (it) also sets in place the foundation for us to do what we should've been doing all along,\" Anderson said in an interview with CNN. The result is an administration that is hardly running from the GOP attack that they are going too big, several White House officials told CNN over the past several weeks. Biden and his team say it's a moment that cannot be missed, one that should be driven by addressing what they view as long-standing structural deficiencies in the economy. That posture underscores why both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill see a bipartisan deal as increasingly unlikely. Biden has made clear he plans to negotiate with Republicans, and will have several to the White House next week. White House officials view the legislative process as different from how it was for the sweeping emergency package enacted in March; it will take time, almost certainly lead to changes and include space and openings for Republicans to come to the table. But the first prong of an expected $4 trillion proposal put on the table, while the opening marker, isn't one White House officials want to see dramatically scaled back. \"He sees this as a moment for taking action,\" one senior administration official told CNN. \"It's not a feint or a negotiating ploy. What he's putting on the table is what he thinks is necessary to address systemic problems we've faced not just over the last year, but for several decades.\"That Biden would be the president to lead the push for dramatic change is surprising to those who worked with and around him during his 36 years on Capitol Hill -- particularly Republicans, some of whom still don't believe he's driving the train. But Biden's top advisers are quick to make clear he is -- and also note he's grown increasingly keen on the legacy such transformative change would create for his presidency.The pandemic has created that opening and, in a sense, the unprecedented measures deployed over the last year -- some under President Donald Trump -- are providing a real-world roadmap for key provisions in what's coming next from the Biden administration.Beyond keeping individuals and households afloat, some of the policies are helping stop the spread of the virus, data suggests, boosting Biden's whole-of-government approach to rein in and quash the pandemic. From data on personal income and employment to food security, housing and educational disruption, the range of nearly real-time information is broadening the understanding of the intersection between the immediate shock the pandemic dealt to the economy and the way it exposed existing underlying economic problems. As Covid-19 laid bare the visceral fragility in segments of the US economy -- like long-standing inequities in minority communities and the vulnerabilities of front-line workers -- top Biden advisers have for months zeroed in on polling that shows Americans open to the kind of aggressive government economic action that has been largely absent for decades. Perhaps most importantly, Biden himself has embraced the expansive view of what the federal government can do to boost the US economy. His repeated mentions of shifting \"the paradigm\" economically aren't hyperbolic, aides say. He sees this as a moment for transformation -- and has no plans to back off plans with a scale and ambition unseen for decades. That's not to say there aren't risks. Political popularity can be fickle, particularly as Republican officials say they are prepared to launch major, and well-funded, attacks on Biden's proposals if he doesn't move to scale them back in negotiations. A narrow House majority and a Senate controlled by Democrats with the slimmest of possible margins mean virtually any single Democrat who breaks ranks can force Biden to recalibrate. The threat looms of overheating an economy awash in newly deployed trillions of dollars, though administration officials are quick to say they are keeping a close eye on things and that the risks of not doing enough far outweigh that threat. Heather Boushey, left, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the coucil, attend a news conference at the White House on March 24.But Biden is surrounded by an economic team that, in many cases, has spent years writing, teaching or speaking about a dramatic rebalancing of the federal government's role in driving economic outcomes. Cecilia Rouse, the chair of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, called the pandemic \"an opportunity to build a better economy in its wake,\" when she was introduced as Biden's nominee last year. \"Structural inequities that have always existed within our economy have not just been exposed, but exacerbated, their impact more devastating than ever before,\" Rouse said earlier this year.Bharat Ramamurti, a key senior adviser to progressive stalwart Sen. Elizabeth Warren, now plays a central role as deputy director at the National Economic Council. Jared Bernstein, chief economic adviser to Biden when he was vice president, has brought his progressive bona fides to the CEA with Rouse. Heather Boushey, a member of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers and a key voice inside the West Wing, even authored a 2019 piece in Democracy Journal talking about how the influx of new economic data and research have driven a dramatic shift in progressive economics. The piece was titled \"A New Economic Paradigm.\" Since entering the White House, top Biden economic officials have been combing through sets of data that simply haven't been available in real time in past recessions -- providing near immediate feedback to the on-the-ground effects of policies as they came online. From US Census Bureau household pulse surveys, academics providing a regular stream of information and even cell phone data, there's a new window into an economy in shock -- and into what it looks like as it shifts toward recovery. Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid relief law marked a cornerstone legislative victory, but a largely temporary one. It extended crucial emergency provisions signed into law by Trump, distributed a third round of direct payments, extended tax credits for paid sick and family leave and extended tens of billions of dollars for rental relief and food aid, all as it enacted significant expansions of the child tax and earned income tax credits. The administration also extended a federal foreclosure moratorium. While the full -- and expectedly significant -- effects of the child tax and earned income tax credits won't be understood for months, the effect of the direct payments, unemployment benefits, paid leave provisions and eviction moratorium already have data behind them -- data White House officials have taken into account. One study on the paid leave provisions, published in Health Affairs, showed that in the 38 states that didn't already have paid sick leave mandates, the new provisions were associated with approximately 400 fewer Covid cases per day. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published by Duke University researchers showed that policies to limit evictions were found to reduce infections by 3.8% and deaths by 11%. Biden's team points to that kind of research to back up the idea that economic support is interconnected with health outcomes, which can create a level of stability for sectors of the economy that have seen anything but over the course of the last decade. \"All this real-time data has really allowed us to trace and have a deeper understanding of the supply side shocks of the pandemic and how that's playing out for our economy,\" Boushey, who spends much of her day tracking the incoming data, told CNN in an interview. Having access to that data, especially on the effects of emergency economic measures deployed to battle the pandemic, has bolstered the case Biden and his team are making for what's coming down the road, officials say. What's next is not only a sweeping $2.25 trillion public works and infrastructure package that includes hundreds of billions for home care, climate spending and investments to historically underserved communities, but also a second proposal that officials say will move to transform the health, education and child care model in the US. Nothing in that data -- or the scale of the instability exposed in the dual crises ushered in by the pandemic -- has dissuaded Biden's economic officials from their desire to go big in the months ahead. \"What 2020 did was it unmasked these fragilities across our economy and across our society,\" Boushey said. \"Ones that were long-standing, but that this crisis brought to the fore and showed us that the long-term cost of not doing something like paid leave can actually be quite devastating in a year like this year.\" Paid leave will be a key component of the second phase of Biden's sweeping recovery proposal, officials tell CNN. So will a longer-term extension of the child tax credit expansion, a provision Anderson -- the top economic official on Biden's Covid team -- played a major role in crafting when he was a senior Senate staffer. Economists project its current iteration, in place for one year, could halve child poverty. Anita Dunn, senior adviser to Biden, circulated a March 31 memo laying out polling data that she said proved Biden's proposal was \"overwhelmingly popular,\" according to a copy obtained by CNN. Among the breakout policies in the memo: expansions of paid leave and childcare options -- both central elements of the second prong of Biden's sweeping $4 trillion jobs and infrastructure package set for release in the coming weeks.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has taken to calling Biden's infrastructure proposal a \"Trojan horse\" of tax increases and progressive policies hidden under the umbrella of infrastructure, an issue that traditionally draws bipartisan support. \"This is a bold left-wing administration,\" McConnell told reporters last week while back home in Kentucky. \"I don't think they have a mandate to do what they're doing.\"Republicans have communicated to White House officials, both publicly and privately, that they are willing to come the table on a more scaled back infrastructure proposal, GOP congressional aides say. If that doesn't happen, Republicans are gearing up to launch full scale attacks against Biden's sweeping new legislative proposals, GOP officials tell CNN -- both from Capitol Hill and from outside groups prepared to spend millions of dollars to try and move the public sharply away from the Democratic White House. Biden's aides, despite the barest of majorities in the House and the Senate, disagree that they lack the mandate. That, officials say, comes from the popularity of the proposals themselves -- with clear majorities in the memo circulated by Dunn.White House officials note that much of what Biden is set to unveil in the coming weeks should not be a surprise -- the bulk of it was in his campaign economic proposals, even if the details were glossed over in a campaign dominated by the pandemic and his predecessor's response to the damage it left in its wake. The sweeping policy proposals made regular appearances in Biden's public remarks, an early hint that the candidate who predicted the \"fever would break\" in the partisan rancor that has consumed Washington, had grander policy ambitions than most expected. \"You won't see this pain if your scorecard is how things are going on Wall Street, but you will see it very clearly if you examine what the twin crises of a pandemic and this sinking economy have laid bare,\" Biden said six days before he took office.Since taking office, Biden has tended toward public references to President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society initiatives and Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal -- far from subtle indications of how he views his approach. \"This is the first time we've been able to, since the Johnson administration and maybe even before that, to begin to change the paradigm,\" Biden said in March, underscoring his desire to transform how the US government approaches economic policy. Whether the popularity, and the scale of Biden's policy ambition, holds over the course of the next several months of negotiations is an open question, particularly amid the prospect of withering Republican attacks. It is one that aides on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue acknowledge may not get its first firm answer until the November 2022 midterm elections. But it is clear the pandemic ripped open long-standing economic issues -- and on its way has created an opportunity to address long-standing Democratic policy priorities. And Biden, advisers say, doesn't plan to let that opportunity pass. \"I want to change the paradigm,\" Biden said in late March, the use of that word once again emphasizing the scale of his intentions. It's not just that the series of unprecedented measures implemented over the course of the last year, punctuated by President Joe Biden $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, are helping to address the pandemic, though that's what the numbers show, said Charlie Anderson, director of economic policy and budget for Biden's Covid-19 response team. \"He sees this as a moment for taking action,\" one senior administration official told CNN. \"It's not a feint or a negotiating ploy. What he's putting on the table is what he thinks is necessary to address systemic problems we've faced not just over the last year, but for several decades.\" That Biden would be the president to lead the push for dramatic change is surprising to those who worked with and around him during his 36 years on Capitol Hill -- particularly Republicans, some of whom still don't believe he's driving the train. But Biden's top advisers are quick to make clear he is -- and also note he's grown increasingly keen on the legacy such transformative change would create for his presidency. The pandemic has created that opening and, in a sense, the unprecedented measures deployed over the last year -- some under President Donald Trump -- are providing a real-world roadmap for key provisions in what's coming next from the Biden administration. Heather Boushey, left, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the coucil, attend a news conference at the White House on March 24. \"Structural inequities that have always existed within our economy have not just been exposed, but exacerbated, their impact more devastating than ever before,\" Rouse said earlier this year. Anita Dunn, senior adviser to Biden, circulated a March 31 memo laying out polling data that she said proved Biden's proposal was \"overwhelmingly popular,\" according to a copy obtained by CNN. Among the breakout policies in the memo: expansions of paid leave and childcare options -- both central elements of the second prong of Biden's sweeping $4 trillion jobs and infrastructure package set for release in the coming weeks. \"This is a bold left-wing administration,\" McConnell told reporters last week while back home in Kentucky. \"I don't think they have a mandate to do what they're doing.\" Republicans have communicated to White House officials, both publicly and privately, that they are willing to come the table on a more scaled back infrastructure proposal, GOP congressional aides say.

NASA's Ingenuity helicopter, originally scheduled to fly on Mars Sunday, is now set to take off no earlier than April 14, according to the agency. The helicopter returned data to mission teams on Earth late Friday evening that caused NASA to reschedule the first flight. The team reports that the helicopter remains safe and healthy and is sharing all of its data. Ingenuity conducted a high-speed test of its rotors Friday. During this test, the command sequence ended early due to a watchdog timer that expired. This early end of the test happened when the helicopter was trying to shift the flight computer from preflight into flight mode. The timer monitors the command sequence, and if any issues arise, it alerts the system and maintains the helicopter's safety by shutting down until the issue can be resolved. In this case, the timer did exactly what it was supposed to do, according to the agency. Meanwhile, the helicopter's team on Earth is reviewing the data so they can determine the issue that shut down the test. After this review, the high-speed test of the helicopter's rotors will be rescheduled. When Ingenuity is able to fly on Mars for the first time, the 4-pound helicopter will fly for about 40 seconds total. The helicopter will spin up its two 4-foot blades, rise up 10 feet (3 meters) in the air, hover, make a turn, take a photo, and touch back down on Mars. If this first flight is successful, Ingenuity could fly up to four more times this month. The little helicopter has checked off multiple milestones so far, like wiggling its blades and surviving the freezing cold nights on Mars. Now, it needs to autonomously fly through the thin Martian atmosphere, with no help from its teams on Earth. Radio signals take 15 minutes and 27 seconds to cross the current gap between Earth and Mars, which spans 173 million miles (278.4 million kilometers). The Perseverance rover, which helps the helicopter and its mission team on Earth communicate with each other, will receive the flight instructions from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The rover will then send those plans on to the helicopter. Perseverance will be parked at an overlook 215 feet (65 meters) away from the helicopter so it can safely watch the flight and capture images and videos.

            "content": "Four suspected members of a group associated with the extremist anti-government Boogaloo movement have been indicted by a federal grand jury in San Francisco, the Justice Department announced Friday.Jessie Alexander Rush, Robert Jesus Blancas, Simon Sage Ybarra, and Kenny Matthew Miksch are charged with destroying records following the May 29 killing of a federal security officer in Oakland and the June 6 slaying of a sheriff's deputy, according to the federal indictment dated March 23, which was unsealed on Friday. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Rush, and Miksch for comment, and is attempting to determine whether Blancas and Ybarra have obtained legal representation. As CNN previously reported, a suspected Boogaloo adherent named Steven Carrillo was arrested last year and has been charged federally for the May 29 killing of a federal protective services officer. Authorities said Carrillo opened fire on a guard booth at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and US Courthouse in Oakland, killing Officer David Patrick Underwood and injuring another.Days later on June 6, authorities allege Carrillo killed Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office. Carrillo has pleaded not guilty to both the federal and state charges, according to court records. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Carrillo for comment.According to the newly unsealed indictment, Carrillo and the four recently indicted defendants were members of a militia-type group in Northern California called the \"Grizzly Scouts.\" On June 1 and 2, 2020, after the alleged killing of the Oakland court officer, the five members communicated via WhatsApp and discussed the Boogaloo movement, as well as killing police officers, according to the federal indictment. On June 6, minutes before allegedly killing a sheriff's deputy, \"Carrillo told the group that he was preparing to engage in a shoot-out with law enforcement,\" and requested the other group members come to his assistance, according to the indictment.After the shooting, Rush, Blancas, Ybarra, and Miksch deleted their WhatsApp conversations regarding the June 6 incident and prior discussions about targeting law enforcement, according to the indictment.\"In the weeks following the shooting, members of the Grizzly Scouts ... repeatedly confirmed with one another that they had destroyed evidence relating to the Grizzly Scouts, of which Carrillo was a member,\" according to the indictment affidavit. As CNN has reported, the Boogaloo Bois or Boys are an emerging incarnation of extremism that seems to defy easy categorization. Boogaloo members appear to hold conflicting ideological views, with some identifying as anarchists and others rejecting formal titles. Some pockets of the group have espoused White supremacy while others reject it.The four defendants are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by destroying records, and the destruction of records in official proceedings, according to the Justice Department release. Rush is charged with an additional count of obstruction of official proceedings and Blancas is charged with an additional count of destruction of records in official proceedings, according to the statement. If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each of the conspiracy, obstruction, and destruction charges.

Court records show 23 charges against Joseph Russo, 28, stemming from the three incidents, ranging from felony charges of assault and criminal negligence as a hate crime to lesser menacing and harassment charges. CNN has reached out for comment to a Legal Aid Society attorney, reportedly representing Russo. CNN was unable to immediately reach a member of Russo's family for comment. The first incident occurred on March 5, when Russo allegedly pushed a 64-year old Asian female to the ground, which caused pain to the left side of her body. Russo then walked away. On the morning of March 22, Russo allegedly pulled the hair of a 32-year-old Asian woman, \"causing pain to her head and neck,\" police said, adding that \"no words were exchanged during the incident and no property was removed.\" On Monday, Russo allegedly pushed a 77-year-old Asian man to the ground in front of a supermarket in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay neighborhood, according to the NYPD. No words were exchanged during that incident either, they said. \"Although the victim sustained bruising to his left arm, he refused medical attention,\" police said. Russo was initially arrested on drug charges, and police allege that he was found with crack cocaine residue and paraphernalia, the NYPD said.The Kings County District Attorney's office confirmed Friday that Russo was being held on $100,000 bail.

Inmates selected from prisons across Maryland will be transferred to Patuxent Institution in Jessup, where they will commence studies. \"Just like the typical admissions process at Georgetown, it will be very competitive,\" Howard said. \"We'll be looking for applicants with a high school diploma or GED who are highly motivated to complete their degree and show potential for academic excellence.\" Inmates participate in the Prison Scholars Program at DC Jail in 2018. The program requires 120 credit hours and will take about five years to complete, according to PJI."

Well, Si Woo Kim, the South Korean who was placed in the top 10 on the second day of the Masters, showed it's not just amateur golfers who have to deal with those emotions and deal with the consequences. Kim was having an excellent round on Friday, firmly in contention at the Augusta National with four birdies in the opening 14 holes.However, on the par-4 14th hole, the 25-year-old just missed his second putt by the smallest of margins, with his three-putt meaning he had to settle for a bogey.An attendant adjusts the scores of golfers from behind a leaderboard during round three of the Masters on Saturday, April 10.Matsuyama finished with a 7-under 65 on Saturday to take a four-shot lead into Sunday's final round.Spectators walk to cover as play is suspended due to inclement weather on April 10.Matt Jones reacts on the 13th hole as a weather warning horn is sounded to suspend play on April 10.Justin Thomas hits his tee shot on the 9th hole during the third round on April 10.

As he waited for his playing partner, he slammed his putter head-first in the ground in anger, breaking it in the process. The world No. 49 also threw his golf ball in the water. As a result, on the biggest stage in golf and still in the hunt for the coveted Green Jacket, Kim was forced to putt the rest of the round using his 3-wood with no spare putter in his bag.Surprisingly, he did extremely well with the makeshift putter, not looking out of place on the greens -- besides the unusual stance.

            "content": "April 10 (UPI) -- NASA has delayed the first flight of the Ingenuity Mars helicopter until at least Wednesday. The agency announced the delay in a Saturday news release after a high-speed test of the helicopter's rotors abruptly stopped Friday. The drone's watchdog timer expired as it was trying to transition the flight computer from \"pre-flight\" to \"flight\" mode, according to NASA. The watchdog timer oversees the command sequences and alerts the system to any potential problems, preventing the system from proceeding when an issue is detected. NASA described the helicopter as \"safe and healthy\" and said the Ingenuity Mars' team is reviewing telemetry to diagnose and understand the full-speed test. Friday's test was the last major one before the helicopter's first scheduled flight. NASA originally planned the first flight for Sunday, though results wouldn't be available until Monday due to transmission delays. The helicopter's two pairs of blades are designed to spin in opposite directions at more than 2,500 rotations per minute. The rotor blades need to spin about eight times faster than typical helicopters in order to power the four-pound drone through Mars' thin atmosphere, which has just 1% of the density of Earth's atmosphere. The Mars rover Perseverance deposited Ingenuity after it landed on Mars in February. The helicopter is designed for a 30-day demonstration, after which Perseverance is scheduled to continue on its primary mission of drilling rock samples in a search for signs of past life on Mars."

In a statement posted to Twitter, Crenshaw said that during an ophthalmologist appointment Thursday, his doctor discovered his retina was detaching and ordered emergency surgery at a VA medical center in Houston. The surgery went well, Crenshaw said, but doctors inserted a gas bubble in his eye to act as a bandage for the retina, which will render him unable to see. \"This is why you're not going to hear from me for a while,\" Crenshaw said. \"I likely will not be conducting interviews and likely will not be posting on social media, except to give updates on my health and recovery.\" His offices in Washington, D.C., and Texas will continue to operate, he added, and encouraged constituents to reach out if they need help. Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, lost an eye to an IED blast in Afghanistan. The same incident caused significant damage to his remaining eye. RELATED Survey: Nearly half of U.S. veterans cite personal growth during pandemic \"This is a terrifying prognosis for someone with one eye, and the nature of the injuries that I sustained in Afghanistan. Anyone who knows the history of my injuries knows that I don't have a 'good eye,' but half a good eye,\" he said. He also said prayers for the full recovery of his vision \"wouldn't hurt\" and would be \"much appreciated.\" \"I have gotten through worse before, and I will get through this,\" Crenshaw said."

            "content": "April 10 (UPI) -- The Supreme Court ruled that California cannot enforce its COVID-19 restrictions limiting number of households gathered in a home for worship to three. The 5-4 ruling, which was released late Friday, overturns the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, which denied motion to prohibit enforcement of restrictions on such gatherings, calling the lower court's decision \"erroneous.\" The majority opinion wasn't signed but included Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed in October. Pastors Jeremy Wong and Karen Busch had argued the restrictions violated right to free exercise of religion, and business owner appellants, such as Ritesh Tandon, named on the suit, had argued that California Gov. Gavin Newsom's restrictions violated First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly. \"California treats some comparable secular activities more favorably than at-home religious exercise, permitting hair salons, retail stores, personal care services, movie theaters, private suites at sporting events and concerts, and indoor restaurants to bring together more than three households at a time,\" the unsigned majority opinion said Friday. In February, the Supreme Court also ordered California to allow indoor church services in Tier 1 counties, identified as having more than seven daily new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people. \"This is the fifth time the court has summarily rejected the Ninth Circuit's analysis of California's COVID restrictions on religious exercise,\" the majority noted. Chief Justice John Roberts joined Justices Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor in dissenting. Kagan, who wrote the dissent, said the state was complying with the First Amendment since it was not treating religious gatherings any differently than secular ones. California's restrictions also limited secular gatherings in one home to three households. \"It has adopted a blanket restriction on at-home gatherings of all kinds, religious and secular alike,\" Kagan wrote. Furthermore, Kagan said in the dissent that at-home gatherings pose more risk for COVID-19 infection than commercial activities for three reasons. First, the interactions tend to be longer. Second, homes tends to be smaller and less ventilated. Third, people are less likely to social distance and wear masks."

Rouhani thanked specialists and officials of the Atomic Energy Organization with a plaque of appreciation during the ceremony Saturday, according to the president's website. \"Design, construction and commissioning of the second phase of the industrial production units in Arak, design and construction of spin test machine, construction and assembly of the first prototype of the IR9S and IR9-1B centrifuges, and design and construction of 3D laser printing of metals,\" were inaugurated Saturday, the website added.

Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear program, in 2018. President Joe Biden has refused to lift sanctions against Iran imposed since U.S. withdrawal from the Obama-era nuclear deal without Iran honoring uranium enrichment limits.

            "content": "CNNs Jim Acosta took a swift swipe Saturday at Tucker Carlson and his most recent racist preachings by indicating that the Fox News host should spell his first name with more than one K, an apparent allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. This is hardly the first time Tucker Carlson  Im not sure why he spells Tucker with just one K  has been accused of making racist comments, Acosta said. He was talking with Brian Stelter, CNNs media correspondent, about the uproar over Carlson peddling the notorious white supremacist great replacement conspiracy theory on Fox News and wondered if the network will again refuse to take any action against Carlson. (Check out the controversy in the video above. Acosta takes his shot at 1:16.) Carlson complained on Thursday that he was being outvoted at the ballot box and blamed it on white replacement via a shadowy plot to recruit immigrants from the Third World. He insisted it wasnt a racist complaint but an issue of voting rights because his candidates dont always win. Why should I sit back and take that? Carlson said. The white supremacist replacement theory claims that an elite cabal, including Jews, are deliberately recruiting immigrants of color to undermine white domination and white Christian culture. The belief has fueled racist mass shooting in the U.S. and elsewhere. Neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 were referring to the fearmongering theory when they chanted, Jews will not replace us. The Daily Show chillingly called Carlson a mass shooter copy cat Friday after he echoed the same sentiments written in manisfestoes by the shooters in El Paso (22 people killed) and Christchurch, New Zealand (51 killed) in 2019. The Anti-Defamation League has called for Carlsons firing. His full on support of the white supremacist theory was not just a dog whistle to racists  it was a bullhorn, stated a letter Friday from the ADL to Fox News. Fox News has not responded. Stelter called Carlson the face of Fox News and the poster child for what [CNN contributor] Van Jones called five years ago the whitelash  this white resistance to a changing country. Carlson has a lot of viewers who seem to be with him, and Fox is not going to take any action against him, Stelter told Acosta. The Fox-owning Murdoch family not only tolerates Carlson, it embraces him and his racism, Stelter added. Hes just a whack job, Acosta noted. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  From a secure room in the Capitol on Jan. 6, as rioters pummeled police and vandalized the building, Vice President Mike Pence tried to assert control. In an urgent phone call to the acting defense secretary, he issued a startling demand. Clear the Capitol, Pence said. Elsewhere in the building, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were making a similarly dire appeal to military leaders, asking the Army to deploy the National Guard. We need help, Schumer, D-N.Y., said in desperation, more than an hour after the Senate chamber had been breached. At the Pentagon, officials were discussing media reports that the mayhem was not confined to Washington and that other state capitals were facing similar violence in what had the makings of a national insurrection. We must establish order, said Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a call with Pentagon leaders. But order would not be restored for hours. These new details about the deadly riot are contained in a previously undisclosed document prepared by the Pentagon for internal use that was obtained by The Associated Press and vetted by current and former government officials. The timeline adds another layer of understanding about the state of fear and panic while the insurrection played out, and lays bare the inaction by then-President Donald Trump and how that void contributed to a slowed response by the military and law enforcement. It shows that the intelligence missteps, tactical errors and bureaucratic delays were eclipsed by the governments failure to comprehend the scale and intensity of a violent uprising by its own citizens. With Trump not engaged, it fell to Pentagon officials, a handful of senior White House aides, the leaders of Congress and the vice president holed up in a secure bunker to manage the chaos. While the timeline helps to crystalize the frantic character of the crisis, the document, along with hours of sworn testimony, provides only an incomplete picture about how the insurrection could have advanced with such swift and lethal force, interrupting the congressional certification of Joe Biden as president and delaying the peaceful transfer of power, the hallmark of American democracy. Lawmakers, protected to this day by National Guard troops, will hear from the inspector general of the Capitol Police this coming week. Any minute that we lost, I need to know why, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which is investigating the siege, said last month. The timeline fills in some of those gaps. At 4:08 p.m. on Jan. 6, as the rioters roamed the Capitol and after they had menacingly called out for Pelosi, D-Calif., and yelled for Pence to be hanged, the vice president was in a secure location, phoning Christopher Miller, the acting defense secretary, and demanding answers. There had been a highly public rift between Trump and Pence, with Trump furious that his vice president refused to halt the Electoral College certification. Interfering with that process was an act that Pence considered unconstitutional. The Constitution makes clear that the vice presidents role in this joint session of Congress is largely ceremonial. Pences call to Miller lasted only a minute. Pence said the Capitol was not secure and he asked military leaders for a deadline for securing the building, according to the document. By this point it had already been two hours since the mob overwhelmed Capitol Police unprepared for an insurrection. Rioters broke into the building, seized the Senate and paraded to the House. In their path, they left destruction and debris. Dozens of officers were wounded, some gravely. Just three days earlier, government leaders had talked about the use of the National Guard. On the afternoon of Jan. 3, as lawmakers were sworn in for the new session of Congress, Miller and Milley gathered with Cabinet members to discuss Jan. 6. They also met with Trump. In that meeting at the White House, Trump approved the activation of the D.C. National Guard and also told the acting defense secretary to take whatever action needed as events unfolded, according to the information obtained by the AP. The next day, Jan. 4, the defense officials spoke by phone with Cabinet members, including the acting attorney general, and finalized details of the Guard deployment. The Guards role was limited to traffic intersections and checkpoints around the city, based in part on strict restrictions mandated by district officials. Miller also authorized Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to deploy, if needed, the D.C. Guards emergency reaction force stationed at Joint Base Andrews. The Trump administration and the Pentagon were wary of a heavy military presence, in part because of criticism officials faced for the seemingly heavy-handed National Guard and law enforcement efforts to counter civil unrest in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In particular, the D.C. Guards use of helicopters to hover over crowds in downtown Washington during those demonstrations drew widespread criticism. That unauthorized move prompted the Pentagon to more closely control the D.C. Guard. There was a lot of things that happened in the spring that the department was criticized for, Robert Salesses, who is serving as the assistant defense secretary for homeland defense and global security, said at a congressional hearing last month. On the eve of Trumps rally Jan. 6 near the White House, the first 255 National Guard troops arrived in the district, and Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed in a letter to the administration that no other military support was needed. By the morning of Jan. 6, crowds started gathering at the Ellipse before Trumps speech. According to the Pentagons plans, the acting defense secretary would only be notified if the crowd swelled beyond 20,000. Before long it was clear that the crowd was far more in control of events than the troops and law enforcement there to maintain order. Trump, just before noon, was giving his speech and he told supporters to march to the Capitol. The crowd at the rally was at least 10,000. By 1:15 p.m., the procession was well on its way there. As protesters reached the Capitol grounds, some immediately became violent, busting through weak police barriers in front of the building and beating up officers who stood in their way. At 1:49 p.m., as the violence escalated, then- Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund called Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, to request assistance. Sunds voice was cracking with emotion, Walker later told a Senate committee. Walker immediately called Army leaders to inform them of the request. Twenty minutes later, around 2:10 p.m., the first rioters were beginning to break through the doors and windows of the Senate. They then started a march through the marbled halls in search of the lawmakers who were counting the electoral votes. Alarms inside the building announced a lockdown. Sund frantically called Walker again and asked for at least 200 guard members and to send more if they are available. But even with the advance Cabinet-level preparation, no help was immediately on the way. Over the next 20 minutes, as senators ran to safety and the rioters broke into the chamber and rifled through their desks, Army Secretary McCarthy spoke with the mayor and Pentagon leaders about Sunds request. On the Pentagons third floor E Ring, senior Army leaders were huddled around the phone for what they described as a panicked call from the D.C. Guard. As the gravity of the situation became clear, McCarthy bolted from the meeting, sprinting down the hall to Millers office and breaking into a meeting. As minutes ticked by, rioters breached additional entrances in the Capitol and made their way to the House. They broke glass in doors that led to the chamber and tried to gain entry as a group of lawmakers was still trapped inside. At 2:25 p.m., McCarthy told his staff to prepare to move the emergency reaction force to the Capitol. The force could be ready to move in 20 minutes. At 2:44 p.m., Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to climb through a window that led to the House floor. Shortly after 3 p.m., McCarthy provided verbal approval of the activation of 1,100 National Guard troops to support the D.C. police and the development of a plan for the troops deployment duties, locations and unit sizes. Minutes later the Guards emergency reaction force left Joint Base Andrews for the D.C. Armory. There, they would prepare to head to the Capitol once Miller, the acting defense secretary, gave final approval. Meanwhile, the Joint Staff set up a video teleconference call that stayed open until about 10 p.m. that night, allowing staff to communicate any updates quickly to military leaders. At 3:19 p.m., Pelosi and Schumer were calling the Pentagon for help and were told the National Guard had been approved. But military and law enforcement leaders struggled over the next 90 minutes to execute the plan as the Army and Guard called all troops in from their checkpoints, issued them new gear, laid out a new plan for their mission and briefed them on their duties. The Guard troops had been prepared only for traffic duties. Army leaders argued that sending them into a volatile combat situation required additional instruction to keep both them and the public safe. By 3:37 p.m., the Pentagon sent its own security forces to guard the homes of defense leaders. No troops had yet reached the Capitol. By 3:44 p.m., the congressional leaders escalated their pleas. Tell POTUS to tweet everyone should leave, Schumer implored the officials, using the acronym for the president of the United States. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., asked about calling up active duty military. At 3:48 p.m., frustrated that the D.C. Guard hadnt fully developed a plan to link up with police, the Army secretary dashed from the Pentagon to D.C. police headquarters to help coordinate with law enforcement. Trump broke his silence at 4:17 p.m., tweeting to his followers to go home and go in peace. By about 4:30 p.m., the military plan was finalized and Walker had approval to send the Guard to the Capitol. The reports of state capitals breached in other places turned out to be bogus. At about 4:40 p.m. Pelosi and Schumer were again on the phone with Milley and the Pentagon leadership, asking Miller to secure the perimeter. But the acrimony was becoming obvious. The congressional leadership on the call accuses the National Security apparatus of knowing that protestors planned to conduct an assault on the Capitol, the timeline said. The call lasts 30 minutes. Pelosis spokesman acknowledges there was a brief discussion of the obvious intelligence failures that led to the insurrection. It would be another hour before the first contingent of 155 Guard members were at the Capitol. Dressed in riot gear, they began arriving at 5:20 p.m. They started moving out the rioters, but there were few, if any, arrests. by police. At 8 p.m. the Capitol was declared secure. Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo in New York, Nomaan Merchant in Houston, and Mary Clare Jalonick, Jill Colvin, Eric Tucker, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long contributed to this report.

OK, Ive tried, begins a lengthy Facebook post by Tyfanee Fortuna, who is fostering Prancer for Second Chance Pet Adoption League in New Jersey. Ive tried for the last several months to post this dog for adoption and make him sound...palatable. The problem is, hes just not. Theres not a very big market for neurotic, man hating, animal hating, children hating dogs that look like gremlins. Prancer, she wrote, embodies the Chihuahua meme that describes the dogs as 50% hate and 50% tremble. Every day we live in the grips of the demonic Chihuahua hellscape he has created in our home, the post states. Its not Prancers fault that he is how he is. Prancer came to me obese, wearing a cashmere sweater, with a bacon egg n cheese stuffed in his crate with him, the post states, going on to explain that his former owner was a woman who treated him like a human and never socialized him. Poor Prancer spent his first few days in his foster home fearful and quiet, but ultimately that gave way to a different kind of personality. I was excited to see him come out of his shell and become a real dog, Fortuna wrote. I am convinced at this point he is not a real dog, but more like a vessel for a traumatized Victorian child that now haunts our home. That said, Prancer does have some good qualities. He is loyal beyond belief, housebroken, knows some commands and loves to be with the person hes bonded with  though that person will have to be a woman or women. (The post warns, If you have a husband dont bother applying, unless you hate him.) She concluded by imploring those who have always wanted your own haunted Victorian child in the body of a small dog that hates men and children to email the rescue. Fortunas Pulitzer-worthy writeup has sparked a lot of interest in Prancer. We are getting a lot of inquires from all over the country but focused on finding him the exact right situation to set him up for success, a Second Chance Pet Adoption League representative named Stephanie told HuffPost in an email. Only adopters who live within a couple of hours of New Jersey will be considered because we need the adopter to be able to meet him in person, maybe a couple of times to bond with him and make sure we are able to help support his adjustment. Stephanie echoed the good and more challenging components of Prancers personality described in the post. One on one with his chosen ladies hes an amazing companion, in the wrong situation hes a demon lol, she wrote. The rescue group also noted on Facebook that while all the attention right now is going to Prancer, there are MANY other small quirky dogs available for adoption on its Petfinder page. In the meantime, people on Twitter are drooling over Prancer and his unique disposition.

            "content": "The Biden administration avoided one of the more challenging early tests of its climate agenda Saturday when two South Korean battery giants feuding over trade secrets reached a settlement to keep a massive Georgia factory complex open, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The White House faced a Sunday deadline to decide whether to veto a U.S. International Trade Commission decision from February that barred SK Innovation from importing the materials needed to build electric vehicle batteries at a $2.6 billion pair of plants in Commerce, Georgia. The case illustrates the new administrations dueling priorities as it seeks to jumpstart efforts to eliminate the U.S. economys planet-heating pollution while going head-to-head with China over intellectual property protections. As late as Friday night, the company looked far from a deal with Seoul-based rival LG Energy Solutions, which convinced the federal trade court that SK Innovation destroyed evidence of stolen trade secrets. In February, the ITC imposed a 10-year import ban on SK Innovation, jeopardizing the supply of batteries for Fords electric F-150 pickup and Volkswagens Crossover series and threatening the 2,600 jobs the company planned to fill in Georgia over the next few years. The ruling also risked delaying President Joe Bidens plans to electrify the nations 276 million some-odd automobiles, the top U.S. source of climate pollution. The deal will also end other ongoing U.S. lawsuits between the two companies, including one in a federal court in Delaware that had been on pause until the ITC saga reached its completion. SK Innovations plant will comprise upward of 35% of the U.S. production capacity of electric vehicle batteries by the end of Bidens first term, when the country is expected to have roughly 11 big powerpack-making factories online. That would likely force automakers to rely more on batteries made in China, which, by contrast, is building some 100 battery plants. The settlement, the details of which were starting to be disclosed Saturday morning, will likely help reverse the ruling and allow SK Innovation to keep its plant open. The agreement is a political win. Leaders across the partisan spectrum pressed for an outcome that would allow the plant to remain open. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) pleaded with Biden to veto the decision if a settlement wasnt reached. In recent weeks, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) held at least one meeting seeking to broker a deal. But ultimately the looming deadline and high stakes of a decision that should define the future of a U.S. set for near exponential growth in the next decade led to an eleventh-hour agreement. Losing the factory without a deal or veto would have sent a chill through the U.S. battery market as it looks to start attracting more players, said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a London-based research firm that specializes in lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicle supply chains. The message that youre sending to those companies by essentially shutting down a plant in the U.S. due to legal reasons does not send a good message, he said before the deal was announced. Its not the most inviting investment environment for someone looking to spend several billion dollars, and then theres a risk something happens and theres a legal intervention and they lose it all. A presidential veto would have been a rare move. The last time the power was used was in 2013, when President Barack Obama blocked an ITC ruling that would have prevented Apple from importing some iPads. Ronald Reagan set the record, vetoing four ITC decisions, including one that coincidentally dealt with batteries. Cities Voted For Green Building Codes. Now Developers Want To End Voting.

But I hear the millions of Americans who feel forgotten, canceled, ignored, marginalized and targeted. I draw confidence knowing that the silent majority is growing louder every day. Its difficult to imagine there are millions of Americans in Gaetzs position just now. Gaetz is currently under investigation by the Justice Department (in a probe that begun during the Trump administration) for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl and paying for her  and other young women  to travel across state lines for sex. Federal investigators are reportedly looking into whether Gaetz used any federal campaign money to make the alleged payments, some of which were reportedly made via Venmo, which produced records. Gaetz is also under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. The committee said in a statement that it was checking into public allegations that Gaetz may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, in violation of House Rules, laws, or other standards of conduct. The FBI is also examining a party plane trip to the Bahamas and female escorts for Gaetz funded by a Florida cannabis entrepreneur in late 2018 or early 2019, several sources told The New York Times. The trip included Gaetz pal and former Florida county tax collector Joel Greenberg, who has been charged with sex trafficking and other crimes, and is reportedly working out a plea deal and cooperating with federal prosecutors.

            "content": "The trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin moved methodically through its second week, giving the jury a more complete picture of the forces that shaped Chauvins deadly interaction with George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Floyd, a Black man, was captured on video that day struggling with a small group of officers for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill until Chauvin, a white man, pinned him to the ground by the neck with his knee for more than nine minutes. Floyd appeared to be unconscious for more than four of those minutes. He was then taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. On Monday morning, jurors heard from the emergency room physician who made the pronouncement, followed by other medical professionals who took the stand to lend their expertise. A steady parade of use of force experts, including Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo, either cast doubt on Chauvins chosen method of restraint or denounced it. In more procedural testimony, lab techs made plain the substances found in the car Floyd was using at the time of his arrest, as well as in the back seat of the police vehicle he was momentarily contained in. Prosecutors used the second week to build on the often emotional testimony from Week 1, which shone a spotlight on the bystanders who agitated over the officers treatment of Floyd. Its been a very strong case on the part of the prosecution, University of Washington law professor Mary Fan told HuffPost after the second week. Howard University associate law professor Justin Hansford told HuffPost he was not really impressed with the prosecutions first week, saying that he did not believe the team focused enough on substantive arguments. This week, I think the prosecution did much better, he said. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to all three of the homicide-related charges against him. If convicted, he could face 11 to 15 years behind bars. Some of the most damning testimony this week came from Dr. Martin Tobin, a renowned pulmonologist who has studied how people breathe for more than four decades. Through diagrams, 3D modeling and mathematical calculations, Tobin walked the jury through the way he believed Floyd died, explaining how Floyds prone position, the placement of his handcuffs, the knee to his neck and knee to his back and left side made breathing difficult and then impossible. (The prone position, a term used frequently at the trial, refers to when a person is lying on their stomach.) Its like the left side is in a vise, Tobin testified. Its totally been pushed in, squeezed in from each side, from the street at the bottom and from the way that the handcuffs are manipulated. It was almost as if Floyds left lung had been surgically removed, Tobin said, adding, Not quite, but along those lines. In a particularly somber moment on the stand, he showed the jury the precise moment he believed Floyd died. The prosecution has had a good day with this star witness. Dr Martin Tobin identified the exact moment George Floyd died and the jury paid attention #DerekChauvinTrial pic.twitter.com/03IRbvRLVI Importantly, Tobin noted that Floyd succumbing to those forces was not an idiosyncrasy, even though he suffered from heart disease and had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system when he died. A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died as a result of what he was subjected to, Tobin testified. Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a consulting forensic pathologist, made a similar remark, telling the courtroom, Theres no evidence to suggest that he wouldve died that night except for the interactions with law enforcement. Both Dr. Bradford Langenfeld, the emergency physician who treated Floyd at the Hennepin County Medical Center, and Dr. Andrew Baker, Hennepin Countys chief medical examiner who performed Floyds first autopsy, determined that asphyxia was the most likely explanation for his death. One of the key issues Chauvins trial highlights is whether its reasonable to expect police to be able to handle people with such conditions  heart disease or addiction issues, as many people in America have  without killing them. Theres a saying in law that one takes ones victim as one finds him, Fan told HuffPost. If you were to push an elderly person to the ground, and they die, you wouldnt say, Well, its their fault. Theyre elderly. In a way, its a distraction issue, Fan said of Floyds health. Arradondo, the Minneapolis police chief, emphasized how Chauvin had absolutely violated the departments policy on use of force on the stand. Theres an initial reasonableness in trying to get him under control in the first few seconds, but once there was no longer any resistance, and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive, and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy, Arradondo said. Its not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics or values. This is the first time that Ive seen some cracks in the so-called blue wall of silence, and it gives me some hope, Boston College of Law professor Robert Bloom told HuffPost. Prosecutors also called to the stand several other law enforcement professionals who specialize in use of force training. Chauvins colleagues with the Minneapolis Police Department stopped short of directly criticizing his actions, but consistently indicated that use of force is expected to let up once a subject stops resisting. One outside specialist, the Los Angeles Police Departments Jody Stiger, said he believed Chauvin wrongly used deadly force against Floyd. The police did seem to try to go out of their way and say that Chauvin used the techniques wrong, or that, you know, he went a little too far, Hansford said. On cross-examination, however, law enforcement largely agreed with defense attorney Eric Nelson when he pointed out that officers have to protect themselves from potential threats, as well. One of Nelsons key objectives is to convince the jury that Chauvin was generally following police training  that what viewers saw on camera is part of the awful but lawful side of police work. I think a lot of this country ... its rare when they actually see people apprehended by police in person, Hansford said. I think most of the country may not know that police sit on people often, police put their knees on the back of people often, this is part of the day-to-day police work. Even the police who testified on behalf of the prosecution, they went to great lengths to make the bad apple argument, he continued. In the process, theyre defending the institution of policing, in terms of the status quo and how it should stay the same. Now, the rest of the world is probably horrified by what they have seen on viral videos of Floyds arrest, Hansford went on. So in a lot of ways, if the defense is persuasive, thats a greater indictment of the police than if, you know, Chauvin was convicted. Next week, the defense is expected to start calling witnesses of their own  offering Chauvins attorneys a necessary chance to strengthen their arguments. Throughout the trial, Nelson has tried to paint the crowd that gathered around Floyd and the arresting officers as a distraction at best, or a threat at worst. He also aims to prove that Floyds preexisting health conditions  and his choice to use drugs  had a more significant effect on the outcome of his arrest than Chauvins actions. Yet at many points during his cross-examination this week, Nelson received pushback over the way he characterized some of the medical elements of Floyds death, casting doubt on his narrative before the jury. His depiction of the crowd may also raise eyebrows in the coming days. Their argument is that there was a rowdy crowd around, and that he lost track of what he was doing because of the rowdy crowd, Bloom said. But then you see this 9-year-old kid. A 17-year-old. You see this poor guy that was in tears having seen this, you know? They didnt look particularly rowdy to me. Its going to be hard to argue that it was not the knee to the neck that was the major contributing cause, Hansford told HuffPost. The trial resumes Monday at about 10 a.m. Eastern time."

Approximately 75,500 Marines have received vaccines, including those now fully vaccinated and partially vaccinated, according to service-wide data obtained by the network. Nearly 48,000 Marines have chosen not to receive the vaccines (38.9%). An additional 102,000 Marines havent yet been offered the vaccines, according to CNN. The Marines are the first military branch to reveal vaccination rates. But the military overall has estimated that two-thirds of service members will decide to have the vaccinations  a rate of 66%, compared to a 61% acceptance rate so far for the Marines, CNN noted. Its not clear why vaccinations have been declined. Authorities speculate that some may be waiting for those more at risk to get the vaccines first, or are waiting for availability elsewhere, rather than through the military, according to CNN. Other reluctance could be linked to safety concerns in connection to the speed the vaccines were developed, or fears scientists say are unfounded about possible long-term effects. We fully understand that widespread acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine provides us with the best means to defeat the pandemic. The key to addressing the pandemic is building vaccine confidence, Marine Corps spokeswoman Col. Kelly Frushour told CNN in a statement. Marine officials are reaching out to service members to encourage them to get the vaccine. The Navy and Marine Corps are providing substantial educational information broadly, and working with commands to ensure Marines, sailors, and beneficiaries have accurate information regarding the safety and efficacy of the vaccines to encourage individuals to get immunized, Marine spokesperson Capt. Andrew Wood said in a statement to The Hill. The military cant yet make vaccines mandatory because the vaccinations have only been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, and service members have the option to decline them. The Defense Department has some 2.2 million service members operating around the globe. Too low a vaccine acceptance rate could affect force readiness, CNN noted.

            "content": "Maryland on Saturday became the first state in the nation to repeal its powerful Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights after the states Democratic-majority legislature overrode Republican Gov. Larry Hogans vetoes of three historic police accountability bills. Hogan announced Friday that he was vetoing the three bills  part of a package of five police reform measures passed by state lawmakers earlier in the week. The governor said he would allow two of the bills to become law without his signature but said the others would further erode police morale, community relationships and public confidence. But Democrats, who hold veto-proof majorities in both the state House and Senate, vowed to override Hogans vetoes  a promise they promptly fulfilled, with lawmakers gathering Friday night and Saturday to make it happen. Governor Hogan just vetoed the most comprehensive reforms to policing in Maryland history.But are we surprised? This is the real Larry Hogan. https://t.co/QtpQXjpjhR One of Hogans vetoes had been for a bill repealing and replacing the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR), which governs the disciplinary process for police officers. Critics have labeled LEOBR an impediment to police accountability. A new procedure to discipline officers found guilty of wrongdoing  one that will involve the input of the police departments and civilians  will now replace the bill of rights. Currently, at least 20 states have versions of a police officers bill of rights. The bills enacted Saturday include several other police accountability measures, such as a statewide use-of-force policy, an expansion of public access to some police disciplinary records, harsher penalties for cases involving excessive use of force, new limits on no-knock warrants and a statewide body-camera mandate. Additionally, the two pieces of legislation Hogan chose not to veto include one that gives Baltimore voters the opportunity to decide whether the city should take full control of the Baltimore Police Department, which has been a state agency since 1860. The other bill allowed by Hogan prohibits police departments from acquiring surplus military equipment and creates an independent unit in the state attorney generals office to investigate deaths involving police. Democratic lawmakers in Maryland  a state thats faced scrutiny in recent years for its police accountability issues  hailed the set of police reforms as transformative and a step toward equality. Bill Ferguson, president of the state Senate, called it one of the most significant and transformative packages of reform of law enforcement in the country, and certainly, what matters more, in the history of Maryland, The Washington Post reported. On Friday, Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) pushed back against the assertion made by some Republican lawmakers that the bills are anti-cop. This is not anti-police legislation. This is equality and fairness legislation, Atterbeary said, adding: This was painstakingly put together for Black and brown folks in our state.

The legislation outlines a new procedure for disciplining officers accused of wrongdoing that would replace the powerful police bill of rights, according to the Post. Civilians would play a role in the process. The measures also include changes to the state's use-of-force guidelines, a mandate for the use of body cameras statewide and limits on the use of no-knock search warrants, among other reforms. The state legislature also voted to override Hogan's veto of a bill that allows individuals sentenced to life in prison as juveniles to become eligible for parole.

The invitation-only event is taking place at the Four Seasons Resort, and the RNC reserved the entire hotel. While Timken, former Ohio GOP chair, was invited to the event because she is a major donor  Mandel was not, so he was asked to leave, according to one of the sources. Despite not having his name on the list, Mandel seized on the opportunity to get some face time with top Republican donors while they all were in one place, one source familiar with his plans told Axios. But when the first event formally kicked off at the hotel Friday night, Mandel and others who did not have credentials were asked to leave. A spokesperson for the RNC declined to comment. Mandel's team did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Those attending the retreat not only have access to big donors, but also key party players, including former President Trump. Saturday evening, the group will travel to Mar-a-Lago, where Trump is expected to deliver remarks and mingle with attendees. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential contender, will also speak. The incident gives Timken more visibility and access to Trump, which is crucial as he continues to be the partys rainmaker and most influential player. It also underscores how Trumps efforts to continue leading the GOP have made all interactions with donors high-stakes. Trump previously showed interest in endorsing Timken, but was ultimately talked out of it by his son, Donald Trump Jr., and other top advisers. Mandel and Timken have long been extremely pro-Trump and both are vying to get the former president's endorsement  which could be the deciding factor in who wins the race to replace Sen.

            "content": "Please enter a valid email. President Biden is considering appointing Matthew Rojansky, head of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, as Russia director on the National Security Council, according to a source familiar with the situation. Rojansky has been praised for his scholarship on Russia and is frequently cited in U.S. media for his expert commentary. But his work has drawn criticism  including in a 2018 open letter from Ukrainian alumni of Kennan that blasted the think tank he runs as an \"unwitting tool of Russias political interference.\" Rojansky has served as director of the Kennan Institute, widely viewed as one of the world's premier think tanks on Russia, since 2013. He was previously deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In 2017, Rojansky decried America's \"Cold War style paranoia about the Russian bogeyman,\" acknowledging that Putin \"is a huge problem for the United States\" while arguing that escalation carries \"unacceptable risks.\" He has consistently called for managing competition with Russia in a way that protects U.S. interests and minimizes risks. \"Russia is not going to go away,\" Rojansky wrote in a National Interest op-ed last year criticizing what he characterized as the overuse of sanctions. \"Peaceful coexistence remains an imperative, no matter how unsavory Putins regime might be.\" 31 Ukrainian alumni of the Kennan Institute wrote an open letter criticizing the think tank's \"growing pro-Kremlin policies, lack of democratic procedures and unprofessional communication with Kennan Institute alumni in Ukraine.\" The letter accused Rojansky of firing the director of the Kennan Institute's Kyiv office for political reasons and appointing a replacement \"known for his biased analysis of Ukraine's post-Euromaidan developments.\" The alumni also condemned the Kennan Institute for hosting pro-Kremlin guests including Alfa Bank President Petr Aven, who was later named in a Treasury report on Russian oligarchs close to Putin. an appearance in former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's guilty plea for unregistered foreign lobbying on behalf of the pro-Putinformer Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. In an April 2013 email cited in a court filing by special counsel Robert Mueller, Manafort wrote: \"This week we directed the efforts of a number of positive news articles that appeared in several prominent publications and in the digital media space.\" One of the articles Manafort linked to was a CNN op-ed by Rojansky, which argued that Yanukovych could win \"greater credibility\" for a \"wide range of reforms\" he had undertaken by releasing opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko from prison. Robert Litwak, senior vice president at the Wilson Center, told Axios in a statement: \"The Wilson Center's Matthew Rojansky is one of the country's top experts on Russia, Ukraine and the region ... The CNN article in question, and all of the Center's work, is the product of independent research and analysis.\" Rojansky's potential appointment comes at a fraught moment in U.S.-Russia relations, with tensions running high over the Kremlin's 2020 election interference, the SolarWinds hack of U.S. agencies, detention of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and recent military buildup along the border of eastern Ukraine. Biden has ruled out an Obama-style \"reset\" of relations, and triggered an early spat with Moscow by labeling Putin a \"killer\" in a TV interview. He sanctioned Russian officials over the attempted poisoning of Navalny and is expected to announce additional sanctions in the coming weeks over the SolarWinds hack and Russia's election meddling. The administration has drawn concerns from U.S. allies and members of Congress, however, for not moving faster and more aggressively with sanctions to stop the completion of the Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would be a huge geopolitical win for Putin. Hawks are worried about what Rojansky's appointment would mean for Biden's resolve to confront Russia. Biden has stressed the importance of engaging with Russia on matters of shared interest, extending the New START nuclear treaty in his first days in office and inviting Putin to a virtual summit on climate change later this month. declined to comment. The NSC's Russia portfolio endured significant turmoil and staff turnover under the Trump administration, with several top officials testifying before Congress in the Trump-Ukraine scandal and another escorted off White House grounds for unspecified security reasons."

            "content": "Please enter a valid email. NASA announced Saturday it rescheduled its Ingenuity Mars helicopter's first experimental flight, originally planned for Sunday. \"During a high-speed spin test of the rotors on Friday, the command sequence controlling the test ended early due to a 'watchdog' timer expiration,\" NASA said in a statement. \"This occurred as it was trying to transition the flight computer from Pre-Flight to Flight mode.\" \"The helicopter is safe and healthy and communicated its full telemetry set to Earth,\" per NASA. The helicopter team will review and diagnose the issue, and then plan to reschedule the full-speed test. If successful, this flight will be the first time a human-built aircraft has flown on a world other than Earth, opening the door to new means of exploring planets far from our own. Ingenuity flew to Mars with the Perseverance rover, which landed in February. The helicopter detached from the rover's underbelly earlier this month and survived its first frigid Martian night solo, paving the way for its first flight. When it takes off, Ingenuity will rev up its rotors and climb to about 10 feet in the air for 30 seconds, collecting photos and engineering data along the way before coming back to the ground. NASA thinks helicopters like Ingenuity would be invaluable as the space agency continues to explore Mars, in part because drones can do reconnaissance work that isn't possible with just rovers, landers and orbiters. Unlike orbiters, helicopters could give scientists and even astronauts on Mars high-definition views of various areas of a planet in context with other regions. \"We have robotic assistants that are paired with astronauts today like on the International Space Station, and so there has been quite a bit of work done in how humans and robots could work together for exploration purposes,\" Bobby Braun, director for planetary science, at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said during a press conference. These types of spacecraft can also move from one place to another relatively quickly and easily, unlike rovers, which take a large amount of planning for a drive. Ingenuity is a proof-of-concept, and it's possible the helicopter won't be able to make it off the ground at all. The atmosphere on Mars where Ingenuity is flying is only 1% as dense as Earth's, making it difficult for the helicopter's rotor blades to loft it into the air. Communications with the helicopter via Perseverance  which acts as a relay station between Earth and Ingenuity  are also difficult because of the time delay in sending signals to and from Mars, forcing scientist to give directions to Ingenuity and then let the little spacecraft work autonomously. Editor's note: This story has been updated throughout to reflect that the test flight has been delayed."

The country on Friday recorded 22,478 coronavirus cases, its highest single-day total, according to Al Jazeera. Health officials confirmed more than 19,660 cases on Saturday, as the surge in new infections follows last month's Iranian holiday celebrations. President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised address on Saturday that the primary driver of the fourth wave is the more contagious coronavirus variant first discovered in the U.K., per Al Jazeera. He also attributed the rise in infections to shopping activity before Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, and other holiday celebrations. Regions across Iran face fresh restrictions to varying degrees depending on how they're classified in the country's color-coded system, Al Jazeera reported. In Tehran and 250 other cities classified as \"red-zones,\" which have the highest positivity rates, most non-essential services must close. Travel throughout \"red-zone\" areas is prohibited, and a curfew for private vehicles is in place between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. The new restrictions are expected to last at least 10 days. \"Authorities have done little to enforce lockdown restrictions and originally resisted a nationwide lockdown to salvage an economy already devastated by tough U.S. sanctions,\" AP noted. Iran has experienced one of worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the Middle East. Fewer than 320,000 vaccine doses had been administered in the country of about 83 million as of April 5, according to the World Health Organization. The country has recorded more than 2 million COVID-19 cases and 64,200 deaths since the pandemic began, semi-official Fars News Agency reported, quoting health officials."

Survivors of trauma and experts explore the chance for post-traumatic growth (PTG) from the traumas of the COVID-19 pandemic. USA TODAY President Joe Biden's administration said Friday additional vaccine doses will not be delivered to states seeing surges in COVID-19 cases, despite appeals from local leaders and some health experts. The administration says its current rollout plan, based on state adult population, is \"fair and equitable.\" \"We're not even halfway through our vaccination program so now is not the time to change course on vaccine allocation,\" said Jeff Zients, coordinator of the White House COVID-19 task force, during Friday's briefing. \"This pandemic has hit every state and every county, hard,\" he added. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she directly requested additional doses from Biden in a recent phone call. The state's seven-day average of new daily cases reached 6,429 on Thursday, its highest point since mid-November and the highest in the country currently, a Detroit Free Press analysis of state data shows. Whitmer argued that surging shots to hot spots is not just a good plan for the state, but a vital piece of a national strategy to combat spiking COVID-19 trends. Experts have also called for surging shots, including Ashish Jha, dean of the school of public health at Brown University. \"This is very upsetting,\" Jha said of the recent spike in cases in a tweet. \"Michigan is struggling. We need to be surging tests, vaccines to the state.\" A forecasting model from University of California, Berkeley found that 1,200 deaths could be prevented in Michigan by July if the state received double allocation of vaccines for two weeks, NPR reported. Iran began a 10-day lockdown Saturday amid a fourth wave of coronavirus infections. Shops are closed and offices are restricted to one-third capacity in its capital Tehran and 250 other cities and towns, which have been declared red zones or areas with the highest positivity rates. While Alabama's statewide mask mandate ended Friday after nearly nine months, Birmingham, the largest city in the state, is keeping mask requirements in place \"because the pandemic still exists and remains a threat,\" Mayor Randall L. Woodfin said. Montgomery, the state's second-largest city, will also continue to require face coverings. The latest forecast from the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations coronavirus model projects nearly 620,000 U.S. deaths by Aug. 1. The forecast improves with 95% mask usage (604,413) and tops out at 697,573 deaths in a worst-case scenario in which fully-vaccinated people return to pre-pandemic levels of mobility. Connecticut plans to provide full summer access to its outdoor recreation areas including state parks, campgrounds, shoreline beaches, boat launches and inland swimming spots after providing partial access last summer at the height of the pandemic, state officials said Friday. Utah's statewide mask mandate expires Saturday, though some businesses and government facilities will continue to require face coverings  including Salt Lake International Airport and the Utah Transit Authority.

The list of colleges and universities that will require COVID-19 vaccinations for new and returning students to attend in-person classes this fall grew again Friday, with the North Carolina school announcing a policy that will cover all undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. \"We know that widespread vaccination will be the only way to facilitate a return to normal and robust campus life,\" Duke President Vincent Price said in a statement on the university's website. Brown in Rhode Island, Northeastern in Boston, Nova Southeastern University in Florida and Fort Lewis College in Colorado have also followed the precedent set by Rutgers in New Jersey and Cornell in New York. It doesnt just make us safer. In the end, it makes our entire community safer,\" Antonio Calcado, Rutgers' chief operating officer, told USA TODAY this week. \"Thats why we think requiring is the way to go versus encouraging. Colleges and universities have been especially hard-hit by coronavirus restrictions, losing students who say theyre tired of paying full-price tuition for virtual learning, and that generally means less money for universities that may already be struggling financially. As Americans are getting COVID-19 vaccinations in record numbers, music venues and comedy clubs have begun preparations to re-open. But even when things can go back to normal, they might not. Some parts of lockdown life may linger, especially streaming. A Bandsintown survey of 1,000 artists found that 85% of them plan to maintain live stream shows as part of their schedules even after in-person shows are doable. The same survey, which surveyed about 6,000 fans as well, also found that more than half of music fans (55%) say they will keep streaming live concerts after in-person shows return. The Supreme Court Friday shot down a California regulation limiting religious worship at home in a 5-4 vote. This is the latest in a series of rulings in which the justices have found that coronavirus pandemic regulations violate the First Amendment's protections of religion. California prohibited at home gatherings in counties hard hit by the pandemic and limited those gatherings elsewhere to no more than three households. The restrictions were challenged by two Christian pastors who wanted to hold Bible studies, prayer meetings and other services in their home. The court said California would need to show that it is more dangerous for people to gather in homes for religious services than in hair salons, retail stores, movie theaters and restaurants, where the state allows people to gather from more than three households. Before the ruling, California had already announced significant changes loosening restrictions on gatherings that go into effect April 15. The changes come after infection rates have gone down in the state. Reports of COVID-19 vaccine side effects support what many have anecdotally observed: women shoulder the bigger burden. Among nearly 7,000 reports processed through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from Dec. 14 to Jan. 13, more than 79% of them came from women. The most frequently reported side effects were headache, fatigue and dizziness. Women also are more likely than men to experience some of the vaccines more unusual side effects, such as an itchy red rash that appears at the injection site. With about 95% of the reactions occurring with the Moderna vaccine, women account for 77% of the vaccines reported side effects. Health experts say this may be because women exhibit a greater immune response to vaccines and men tend to underreport their side effects. Another possible explanation from experts is gender bias in clinical research  such as adult men and women receiving the same dose of a vaccine regardless of size  which may mean women are getting a stronger dose than is necessary to trigger an adequate immune response. A Florida woman was sentenced to 29 days in jail for assault this week after she was captured on video coughing in the face of another woman, a cancer patient with a compromised immune system, last year at a Jacksonville-area mall. Debra Jo Michele Hunter, of Fernandina Beach, also made an obscene gesture toward Heather Sprague, who was wearing a mask to further protect herself after recent brain tumor surgery, in a video that gained widespread attention. Duval County Court Judge James Ruth heard testimony from Hunter's husband, friends and family who said she has a \"really huge heart\" and was \"broken-hearted\" over the incident. Sprague, who told the judge she feared being attacked for wearing a mask, described Hunter's actions as \"rooted in privilege and entitlement.\" Pfizer and its German collaborator BioNTech on Friday asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow their COVID-19 vaccine to be used on adolescents ages 12-15. Their vaccine is already authorized for those 16 and up. The companies also plan to ask for similar authorization from regulatory agencies in other parts of the world. In trial results released recently, the companies showed that their vaccine prevented all COVID-19 symptomatic disease in trial participants ages 12-15, generated large numbers of protective antibodies in that age group, and did not pose any safety concerns. The companies will follow all of the more than 2,200 trial participants for two years after their second dose to ensure safety and vaccine durability. The coronavirus outbreak sent profits plunging at Atlantic City's casinos by more than 80% last year, according to figures released Friday by New Jersey gambling regulators. Still, seven of the nine casinos managed to eke out a profit, no matter how small, during what New Jersey Casino Control Commission chairman James Plousis called the \"most challenging year in history\" for the city and its casinos. The state Division of Gaming Enforcement reported the nine casinos collectively posted $117.5 million in gross operating profits in 2020. That was down from nearly $594 million a year earlier, before the pandemic forced casinos to close for 3 1/2 months, and limited their operations even after reopening."

Wochit Nearly 40% of United States Marines who have been offered the COVID-19 vaccine have declined it, according to the Pentagon. Of the 123,500 Marines that have had access to the vaccine, 75,500 Marines are either fully vaccinated or have only received one dose while about 48,000 have declined it, Communication Strategy and Operations Officer Capt. Andrew Woods told USA TODAY. \"We fully understand that widespread acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine provides us with the best means to defeat this pandemic. The key to addressing this pandemic is building vaccine confidence,\" he said, confirming a statistic first reported by CNN. Woods said the Navy and Marine Corp were working to ensure that soldiers have accurate information about the safety of the vaccine and want to encourage people to get it. Woods said service members may have declined the offer for any one of a variety of reasons, including wanting to allow others to get the vaccine before them; having already received the vaccine through other channels; or waiting until the military makes receiving the vaccine mandatory, which it has yet to do. Since the Department of Defense only has emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for the COVID vaccine, the department cant make receiving the vaccine mandatory for service members, but President Joe Biden could issue a waiver. Seven Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to issue a waiver of informed consent to require all U.S. military service members to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The letter, obtained by CNN, said while the Pentagon has \"made admirable efforts to educate service members on the safety and efficacy\" of the vaccine, those efforts have been \"outpaced by disinformation dominating social media.\" Rutgers, Cornell mandate COVID-19 vaccines for students. Is this the new norm for college? While about 38.9% of Marines have refused to get the vaccine, the acceptance rate of receiving the vaccine among them is about 61.1%. Based on data shared with CNN by the Marine Corps, the refusal rate at one prominent Marine Corps base, Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, was significantly higher with 57% of Marines refusing the vaccine. Of the 26,400 Marines at Camp Lejeune who have been offered the vaccine, 15,100 chose not to get it, including members from the II Marine Expeditionary Force and Marines Corps Installation East. Over 100,000 Marines have yet to be offered the vaccine, Wood said."

Authorities investigating the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol say two extremist groups that traveled to Washington along with thousands of other Trump supporters weren't whipped into an impulsive frenzy by President Donald Trump. (March 10) AP Domestic WASHINGTON  From a secure room in the Capitol on Jan. 6, as rioters pummeled police and vandalized the building, Vice President Mike Pence tried to assert control. In an urgent phone call to the acting defense secretary, he issued a startling demand. Clear the Capitol, Pence said. Elsewhere in the building, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were making a similarly dire appeal to military leaders, asking the Army to deploy the National Guard. We need help, Schumer, D-N.Y., said in desperation, more than an hour after the Senate chamber had been breached. At the Pentagon, officials were discussing media reports that the mayhem was not confined to Washington and that other state capitals were facing similar violence in what had the makings of a national insurrection. We must establish order, said Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a call with Pentagon leaders. But order would not be restored for hours. These new details about the deadly riot are contained in a previously undisclosed document prepared by the Pentagon for internal use that was obtained by The Associated Press and vetted by current and former government officials. The timeline adds another layer of understanding about the state of fear and panic while the insurrection played out, and lays bare the inaction by then-President Donald Trump and how that void contributed to a slowed response by the military and law enforcement. It shows that the intelligence missteps, tactical errors and bureaucratic delays were eclipsed by the governments failure to comprehend the scale and intensity of a violent uprising by its own citizens. With Trump not engaged, it fell to Pentagon officials, a handful of senior White House aides, the leaders of Congress and the vice president holed up in a secure bunker to manage the chaos. While the timeline helps to crystalize the frantic character of the crisis, the document, along with hours of sworn testimony, provides only an incomplete picture about how the insurrection could have advanced with such swift and lethal force, interrupting the congressional certification of Joe Biden as president and delaying the peaceful transfer of power, the hallmark of American democracy. Lawmakers, protected to this day by National Guard troops, will hear from the inspector general of the Capitol Police this coming week. Any minute that we lost, I need to know why, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which is investigating the siege, said last month. The timeline fills in some of those gaps. At 4:08 p.m. on Jan. 6, as the rioters roamed the Capitol and after they had menacingly called out for Pelosi, D-Calif., and yelled for Pence to be hanged, the vice president was in a secure location, phoning Christopher Miller, the acting defense secretary, and demanding answers. There had been a highly public rift between Trump and Pence, with Trump furious that his vice president refused to halt the Electoral College certification. Interfering with that process was an act that Pence considered unconstitutional. The Constitution makes clear that the vice presidents role in this joint session of Congress is largely ceremonial. Pences call to Miller lasted only a minute. Pence said the Capitol was not secure and he asked military leaders for a deadline for securing the building, according to the document. By this point it had already been two hours since the mob overwhelmed Capitol Police unprepared for an insurrection. Rioters broke into the building, seized the Senate and paraded to the House. In their path, they left destruction and debris. Dozens of officers were wounded, some gravely. Just three days earlier, government leaders had talked about the use of the National Guard. On the afternoon of Jan. 3, as lawmakers were sworn in for the new session of Congress, Miller and Milley gathered with Cabinet members to discuss Jan. 6. They also met with Trump. In that meeting at the White House, Trump approved the activation of the D.C. National Guard and also told the acting defense secretary to take whatever action needed as events unfolded, according to the information obtained by the AP. The next day, Jan. 4, the defense officials spoke by phone with Cabinet members, including the acting attorney general, and finalized details of the Guard deployment. The Guards role was limited to traffic intersections and checkpoints around the city, based in part on strict restrictions mandated by district officials. Miller also authorized Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to deploy, if needed, the D.C. Guards emergency reaction force stationed at Joint Base Andrews. The Trump administration and the Pentagon were wary of a heavy military presence, in part because of criticism officials faced for the seemingly heavy-handed National Guard and law enforcement efforts to counter civil unrest in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In particular, the D.C. Guards use of helicopters to hover over crowds in downtown Washington during those demonstrations drew widespread criticism. That unauthorized move prompted the Pentagon to more closely control the D.C. Guard. There was a lot of things that happened in the spring that the department was criticized for, Robert Salesses, who is serving as the assistant defense secretary for homeland defense and global security, said at a congressional hearing last month. On the eve of Trumps rally Jan. 6 near the White House, the first 255 National Guard troops arrived in the district, and Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed in a letter to the administration that no other military support was needed. By the morning of Jan. 6, crowds started gathering at the Ellipse before Trumps speech. According to the Pentagons plans, the acting defense secretary would only be notified if the crowd swelled beyond 20,000. Before long it was clear that the crowd was far more in control of events than the troops and law enforcement there to maintain order. Trump, just before noon, was giving his speech and he told supporters to march to the Capitol. The crowd at the rally was at least 10,000. By 1:15 p.m., the procession was well on its way there. As protesters reached the Capitol grounds, some immediately became violent, busting through weak police barriers in front of the building and beating up officers who stood in their way. At 1:49 p.m., as the violence escalated, then- Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund called Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, to request assistance. Sunds voice was cracking with emotion, Walker later told a Senate committee. Walker immediately called Army leaders to inform them of the request. Twenty minutes later, around 2:10 p.m., the first rioters were beginning to break through the doors and windows of the Senate. They then started a march through the marbled halls in search of the lawmakers who were counting the electoral votes. Alarms inside the building announced a lockdown. Sund frantically called Walker again and asked for at least 200 guard members and to send more if they are available. But even with the advance Cabinet-level preparation, no help was immediately on the way. Over the next 20 minutes, as senators ran to safety and the rioters broke into the chamber and rifled through their desks, Army Secretary McCarthy spoke with the mayor and Pentagon leaders about Sunds request. On the Pentagons third floor E Ring, senior Army leaders were huddled around the phone for what they described as a panicked call from the D.C. Guard. As the gravity of the situation became clear, McCarthy bolted from the meeting, sprinting down the hall to Millers office and breaking into a meeting. As minutes ticked by, rioters breached additional entrances in the Capitol and made their way to the House. They broke glass in doors that led to the chamber and tried to gain entry as a group of lawmakers was still trapped inside. At 2:25 p.m., McCarthy told his staff to prepare to move the emergency reaction force to the Capitol. The force could be ready to move in 20 minutes. At 2:44 p.m., Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to climb through a window that led to the House floor. Shortly after 3 p.m., McCarthy provided verbal approval of the activation of 1,100 National Guard troops to support the D.C. police and the development of a plan for the troops deployment duties, locations and unit sizes. Minutes later the Guards emergency reaction force left Joint Base Andrews for the D.C. Armory. There, they would prepare to head to the Capitol once Miller, the acting defense secretary, gave final approval. Meanwhile, the Joint Staff set up a video teleconference call that stayed open until about 10 p.m. that night, allowing staff to communicate any updates quickly to military leaders. At 3:19 p.m., Pelosi and Schumer were calling the Pentagon for help and were told the National Guard had been approved. But military and law enforcement leaders struggled over the next 90 minutes to execute the plan as the Army and Guard called all troops in from their checkpoints, issued them new gear, laid out a new plan for their mission and briefed them on their duties. The Guard troops had been prepared only for traffic duties. Army leaders argued that sending them into a volatile combat situation required additional instruction to keep both them and the public safe. By 3:37 p.m., the Pentagon sent its own security forces to guard the homes of defense leaders. No troops had yet reached the Capitol. By 3:44 p.m., the congressional leaders escalated their pleas. Tell POTUS to tweet everyone should leave, Schumer implored the officials, using the acronym for the president of the United States. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., asked about calling up active duty military. At 3:48 p.m., frustrated that the D.C. Guard hadnt fully developed a plan to link up with police, the Army secretary dashed from the Pentagon to D.C. police headquarters to help coordinate with law enforcement. Trump broke his silence at 4:17 p.m., tweeting to his followers to go home and go in peace. By about 4:30 p.m., the military plan was finalized and Walker had approval to send the Guard to the Capitol. The reports of state capitals breached in other places turned out to be bogus. At about 4:40 p.m. Pelosi and Schumer were again on the phone with Milley and the Pentagon leadership, asking Miller to secure the perimeter. But the acrimony was becoming obvious. The congressional leadership on the call accuses the National Security apparatus of knowing that protestors planned to conduct an assault on the Capitol, the timeline said. The call lasts 30 minutes. Pelosis spokesman acknowledges there was a brief discussion of the obvious intelligence failures that led to the insurrection. It would be another hour before the first contingent of 155 Guard members were at the Capitol. Dressed in riot gear, they began arriving at 5:20 p.m. They started moving out the rioters, but there were few, if any, arrests. by police. At 8 p.m. the Capitol was declared secure.

Former President Donald Trump called for GOP unity at a conservative convention in Orlando, Florida and then called out by name the 17 Republican House and Senate members who voted to impeach or convict him. (March 1) AP Domestic PALM BEACH, Fla.  As Floridians hit the beaches on a bright and hot day, Donald Trump and wealthy Republicans huddled behind closed doors Saturday to discuss GOP unity  a challenging topic in the wake of Trump's loss in last year's presidential election. Trump echoed his plans to endorse allies  and target enemies  in GOP primaries next year, threatening party divisions ahead of the 2022 congressional elections, a top agenda item at this weekend's Republican National Committee spring retreat. In a retreat dinner speech to be given at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump plans to trumpet his presidential record, and to tell party donors that continuing it is the key to future elections. \"Our American First platform will lead the Republican Party back to power,\" Trump plans to say, according to an advance text. In addition to private discussions all over the Four Seasons beach resort, Republican lawmakers and donors held panel discussions Saturday on campaign plans, prior to departing for Mar-a-Lago and the Trump-hosted dinner. All the RNC activities are closed to the press. The Saturday schedule at the retreat included an event called a \"Party Unity Panel,\" one of the challenges facing Republicans this election cycle. In another departure from previous ex-president, Trump is endorsing allies running in party primaries, often to retaliate against Republicans who favored impeachment after the Jan. 6 insurrection by pro-Trump protesters at the U.S. Capitol. Trump has also attacked Republicans who criticized his efforts to overturn his election loss to President Joe Biden. That group includes Senate Republican leader and party kingmaker Mitch McConnell. Other Republicans  including Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a member of House GOP leadership who voted for impeachment  have urged the party to move past Trump. Active involvement in primaries  unusual for any high-profile politician, especially an ex-president  threatens to split the party, making it harder to win closely contested congressional districts and states. Trump does not plan to attack any Republicans during his speech, according to the advance text, but instead train fire on the Biden administration. He plans to attack the new president over immigration and border policy, dealings with China, new talks on the Iran nuclear deal, and for holding off on a televised speech to Congress. Another Trump target is \"woke corporations,\" including Major League Baseball for its decision to pull the All Star Game from Atlanta because of new voting laws in Georgia. Predicting Republican victories in the 2022 congressional races and in the 2024 presidential race  if they follow his agenda  Trump is expected to repeat a 2020 campaign mantra, according to the text: \"For our party, our movement, and our country, they best is yet to come.\" House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.  who has often called for party unity, and took a special trip to Palm Beach two months ago to speak with Trump about the 2022 elections  hosted a dinner Friday night at the RNC retreat in Palm Beach. In his remarks, attendees said, McCarthy talked about another key element in next year's elections: The drawing of new congressional districts in each state. McCarthy also said Republicans should run against Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and that \"Retiring Nancy\" should be a major campaign theme. Saturday's unity panel featured party chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and the leaders of the Republican congressional campaign arms: Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who heads up the National Republican Senate Committee. Planners devoted other Saturday panels to items most Republicans can agree on, including \"Big Tech Censorship\" and \"Growing The Party.\" The latter topic is important for a party that has struggled with women and voters of color, which led to difficulties in the suburbs in Trump's defeat last year. Party members who attended the retreat, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings, said GOP members believe they can work out problems between Trump and anti-Trump Republicans. \"Our folks still like him,\" one Republican said. The 2024 presidential race is also on the minds of some Republicans. Prospective presidential candidates who signed up for the retreat include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, , and both of Florida's Republican senators, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio. There's also Trump, who has said it is too early to decide whether he will run again in 2024. In the meantime, GOP members are hopeful about next year's congressional elections because Democrats hold narrow majorities in both the House and Senate. The Democrats also have high hopes, and are using the Republican retreat to try and raise money for their candidates. In a fundraising solicitations throughout the week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee warned supporters that Trump's \"top cronies\" descended on Palm Beach to figure out how to outspend their opponents. \"Trump and his Republicans are holding their BIGGEST fundraiser of the year at Mar-a-Lago,\" said a DCCC email on Saturday. \"Elite GOP donors are flooding in to raise the cash theyll need to undo our Majority once and for all.\" Democrats, who plan to make a Trump an issue in next year's congressional elections, also made their presence felt in Palm Beach itself. The Democratic National Committee sponsored a \"moving billboard\" that trucked South Ocean Boulevard between the Four Seasons and Ma-a-Lago, promoting the Biden administration's efforts to end the COVID pandemic. \"No thanks to Republicans,\" said one side of the billboard. DNC spokesperson Ammar Moussa described the Republican donors and politicians as \"mini-Trumps\" hobnobbing at Mar-a-Lago, while Biden and the Democrats \"are delivering for everyday Americans, putting vaccines in arms, money in pockets, and bringing normalcy back. Republican leaders said they believe opposition to Biden and his big-spending plans will unite their party. Some current and former members said the Republican Party is already unified: They are firmly behind Trump, and that could lead to defeats like the one he took in last year's presidential election. Trump's control is obvious because \"everyone who is considering running for president is making the pilgrimage to Florida to kiss the ring and, more importantly, echo Trumps rhetoric,\" said Republican strategist Doug Heye. Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and now a Trump critic, said GOP members who oppose the ex-president have either left the party or given up. Said Walsh: \"Its a unified, shrinking, dying party.\""

A Black and Latino U.S. Army lieutenant is suing two Virginia police officers who drew their guns and pepper-sprayed him during a traffic stop. (April 9) AP Domestic A U.S. Army officer is suing two Virginia police officers after a December traffic stop in which the officers drew and pointed their weapons, pepper-sprayed him and used a slang term to suggest he would face execution as he purposefully held both hands aloft in attempts to defuse the situation. Police in Windsor, in southeast Virginia, have yet to issue any comment about the incident involving second lieutenant Caron Nazario, a Black and Latino man who was in uniform when officers ordered him to exit his Chevrolet Tahoe as he held his hands up through the drivers side window outside a local gas station. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court in Norfolk and obtained by The Washington Post, alleges the officers violated Nazarios constitutional rights during the stop and that the officers further threatened to destroy the lieutenant's military career \"with a series of baseless criminal charges\" if he reported them for misconduct. Video of the December 5 incident was captured by both officers' body cameras and on Nazario's cell phone, the suit said. Whats going on? Nazario asked the officers, who shouted at him to get out of the SUV as they approached, guns drawn. What should you do if you see police using excessive force? Legal experts say film it, just as bystanders did in George Floyd's death. Whats going on is youre fixin to ride the lighting, son, one replied, using a slang term for the electric chair in a line from the film, \"The Green Mile.\" Im honestly afraid to get out, Nazario told the officers. Yeah, you should be! one retorted. Jonathan Arthur, Nazarios attorney, told the Associated Press the Virginia State University graduate was on his way home from his duty station when the incident occurred. Hes definitely not doing too well, he said, asked about Nazarios condition. In his report, included in the court filing, Windsor police officer Daniel Crocker had reported encountering a vehicle with tinted windows and without a rear license plate, describing it in radio transmissions as eluding police and labeling it a high-risk traffic stop. According to the suit, Nazario explained at the time that he had slowed down wasnt attempting to elude the officer but instead looking for an illuminated location for officer safety and out of respect for the officers. His newly purchased Tahoe was so new that he had temporary cardboard tags displayed in both the rear and passenger windows, the suit said. A second officer, Joe Gutierrez, was in the vicinity when Crockers call went out and opted to join the stop. Arthur said Gutierrez told him that Nazarios choice to continue to a well-lit area is not uncommon, and 80% of the time, its a minority, he quoted the officer as saying. Thought Nazarios rear plate became visible under the glare of the fuel station, the suit says Crocker and Gutierrez immediately left their squad cars and drew their weapons, attempting to extract Nazario from his SUV as he held his hands high and repeatedly asking what he had done wrong. The footage shows Gutierrez pepper-spraying Nazario several times as the officers continue to order him to remove his seat belt and exit his vehicle. His eyes shut in pain as he resisted the impulse to wipe them, Nazario told the officers: I dont even want to reach for my seatbelt  can you please. My hands are out, can you please  look, this is really messed up, After Nazario eventually climbed out of the car, he was brought down with knee strikes as he continued to ask for a police supervisor, the lawsuit said, then struck several times and handcuffed. The officers searched the SUV, where they found a handgun, but replaced it after determining it was legally owned. The suit said that after questioning Nazario, the officers threatened to derail his military career \"knowing the harm criminal charges would cause him\" and told him they would refrain from filing charges if he would \"chill and let this go.\" According to the suit, the officers altered or omitted details about the stop in their subsequent reports. These cameras captured footage of behavior consistent with a disgusting nationwide trend of law enforcement officers, who, believing they can operate with complete impunity, engage in unprofessional, discourteous, racially biased, dangerous and sometimes deadly abuses of authority, the lawsuit said. Both officers still work for the department, Windsors town manager told The Virginian-Pilot. USA TODAY attempted to contact Windsor police, who did not answer a call. A voicemail reported the mailbox as full."

            "content": "A Gaston County man who initially survived a horrific mass shooting in rural York County, South Carolina, on Wednesday has now died, becoming the sixth person killed by former NFL player Phillip Adams, who later took his own life. GSM Services, the Gastonia, N.C.-based HVAC company that employed Robert Shook, announced his passing Saturday night. \"It is with much sadness that we announce that late this afternoon our beloved co-worker, Robert Shook, succumbed to his injuries and passed from this earthly world. We are all heartbroken and our attention must turn to comforting each other and Roberts family,\" reads the announcement from the company's owners, Joel and Steven Long. \"Please keep his family in your prayers tonight and in the coming days as we all face this together.\" Shook and his GSM co-worker, James Lewis of Gastonia, were at the York County, South Carolina, home of 70-year-old Dr. Robert Lesslie and his wife, Barbara, 69, working when the shooting took place around 4:44 p.m. Wednesday. Dr. Lesslie and his wife died in the shooting, along with two of their grandchildren, 9-year-old Adah and 5-year-old Noah. Adams, a journeyman cornerback who played for six NFL teams from 2010-15, would take his life after an hours-long standoff with police at his nearby home. He was confirmed dead around 2:37 a.m. Thursday, according to the York County Sheriff's Office. Shook, who family members said was shot six times, would use his cellphone to call his work supervisor at Gastonia-based GSM Services for help, despite his injuries. His supervisor then called 911. Shook fought for his life at Atrium Health's Carolina's Medical Center in Charlotte for four days. Doctors told family members from the beginning his chances of surviving were slim. His family and co-workers at GSM asked for the community to pray for Shook's recovery on Friday. Shook, like Lewis, was 38 years old and both men had three children. Heather Thompson, a Shook family spokesman, described her cousin on Friday as \"Superman.\" \"He loves his kids,\" Thompson said Friday. \"He walks this earth and puts those work boots on every day for those three kids of his and his wife, Thompson said. Lewis was a single father of three children. Lewis was an only child. His father and mother had moved from Michigan to Gastonia to be closer to their son and grandchildren. They described him Thursday as a hard worker who loved his children. I keep on expecting to wake up. Oh, that was just a bad dream. Its not. Its real, Tom Lewis said Thursday. Dr. Lesslie was a beloved physician in the Rock Hill, community, a city of about 75,000 people. He had worked in the local hospital's emergency room for decades and also started two area urgent care centers. The Lesslie family released a statement through the Sheriff's Office describing their grief and calling for prayers for all involved, including the suspect's family. \"We are truly in the midst of the unimaginable,\" the Lesslie family said in statement. \"The losses we are suffering cannot be uttered at this time. While we know there are no answers that will satisfy the question 'why,' we are sure of one thing: We do not grieve as those without hope. Our hope is found in the promise of Jesus Christ. To that end, our hearts are bent toward forgiveness and peace.\" The Lesslie family encouraged people wanting to do something for the family to stock the free pantries and libraries in your community and to donate to Camp Joy North Carolina. Dr. Lesslie volunteered at the camp for more than 20 years as camp physician, according to Brent Turner, executive director of the organization that oversees the camp. Robert Lesslie and Barbara Lesslie, who served as Bible teacher, worked at the camp in Flat Rock, nestled in the North Carolina mountains. They made the summer visits a family affair, bringing children and grandchildren as fellow volunteers. You can reach Kevin Ellis at 704-869-1823 or email him at kellis@gastongazette.com.

At least two deaths and multiple injuries have been reported in Louisiana following severe weather Friday night and Saturday morning. One person was killed and seven injured after at least one tornado touched down in St. Landry Parish. Separately, in Shreveport, a 48-year-old man was killed when a tree fell on his mobile home amid strong winds, said Caddo Sheriff Steve Prator. The same storm system caused significant damage 400 miles to the east in Bay County, Florida, where an image showed the remains of a Panama City Beach convenience store with its roof and walls largely gone and aisles of merchandise intact. As of Saturday afternoon, more than 50,000 people were without power across Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, according to PowerOutage.us. The tornado hit St. Landry Parish at about 2:15 a.m. Saturday as severe weather rolled across the state, according to a release from parish Director of Emergency Preparedness Van Reed. The National Weather Service confirmed the tornado was either an EF2 or EF3 with 130 mph winds. Investigators are still determining whether it was the same tornado or an additional tornado that hit a second location at about 2:30 a.m. Eight homes were destroyed and two were damaged. Of the seven people injured, five have been released from the hospital while two remain hospitalized. My thoughts and prayers are with the families affected by this storm, St. Landry Parish President Jessie Bellard said in a statement. Were doing everything we can to help those families. Bellard, who was aiding investigators at the scene, said the damage is significant. Its really unbelievable. You really have to see it to understand what happened out here. Several homes have been moved off their foundations and others have had their roofs pulled off. One house was moved and placed completely onto the road, Bellard said. According to Bellard, the person who died in St. Landry Parishwas possibly thrown from his residence. Bellard said the tornado is presumed to have touched down at two different areas in the northern portion of St. Landry Parish. Moses Celestine, 90, who was in his home when the storm hit, called it \"frightening and scary.\" \"All at once I heard the house shaking and moving and it felt like it lasted 20 minutes,\" he said. According to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, severe storms could develop overnight across the Florida Panhandle but are expected to be far less intense.

James Clyburns legislation aims to close the so-called Charleston loophole, which allows people with incomplete background checks to purchase guns after three days. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn thinks Congress can pass bipartisan legislation on stricter gun background checks rules and federal guidelines on red flag laws despite staunch Republican opposition, he said Saturday. In March, the House passed a Clyburn-sponsored bill increasing the waiting time required for background checks from three business days to 10. Why is it so important to get a gun in three days? What's wrong with 10 days? We wait 30 days to get something in the mail when we order it online, the South Carolina Democrat said in an interview on MSNBC Saturday morning. I believe that there are more and more people coming to that conclusion. I think that we can get a bipartisan bill done. I do believe that if the Senate were to get the bill to the floor, I think it'll pass. Clyburns legislation aims to close the so-called Charleston loophole, which allows people with incomplete background checks to purchase guns after three days. Clyburn has pushed for the legislation after a gunman killed nine people at a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015. Such legislation faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where it would require 10 Republicans to get on board with all Democrats. Democrats have unsuccessfully tried several times to pass stricter gun laws in recent years, with calls for action increasing after mass shootings last month in Georgia and Colorado. Clyburns optimism for legislative action comes after President Joe Biden unveiled a slew of executive actions Thursday with the aim of slowing what he called an international embarrassment of gun violence. Those included reining in \"ghost guns\" and requiring the Department of Justice to give a new report yearly on gun trafficking, among other things. He also called for the Justice Department to author model red-flag gun law legislation for states. Biden also called on the Senate to pass the House-approved legislation closing the Charleston loophole, adding universal background checks and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. In the interview Saturday morning, Clyburn also echoed Bidens sentiments on a wave of GOP-backed state laws that add restrictions on voting in the name of \"election security,\" pushed despite no evidence of widespread fraud. It is the most massive voter suppression activity to take place since the Jim Crow laws, Clyburn said. I happen, as you know, to study history pretty much daily. And I can tell you that just because you say it is something, we have to look at the effect of it."

People walk in downtown Annapolis, Md., holding Black Lives Matter signs. | Julio Cortez/AP Photo Marylands Democrat-controlled legislature on Saturday moved to pass a sweeping police reform package that repealed the states police Bill of Rights, becoming the first state in the nation to do so and overriding Republican Gov. Larry Hogans vetoes in the process. The states police Bill of Rights covered due process for officers accused of misconduct. Advocates for repeal have called it \"one of the most extreme in the nation. The new law will also give more oversight power to civilians. Another one of the bills Hogan vetoed will require \"certain\" no-knock warrants to be approved by both a supervisor and the State's Attorney and be between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., barring \"exigent circumstances. One of the new laws will also require officers to use force only if it is \"necessary and proportional.\" The move, a win for police reform advocates, comes amid a national reckoning with policing after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer last year. Many states have considered police reform in wake of Floyd's death. \"Maryland is leading the country in transforming our broken policing system,\" Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat, wrote in a tweet Saturday. \"Now, for the first time in our nation's history, the rights of officers will not be held above the rights of individuals, and policing in Maryland will be transparent and citizen-centered.\" Maryland first instituted its Bill of Rights in 1974 and about 20 states have since adopted similar measures. Hogan said he had to veto the bills to keep Marylanders safe. These bills would undermine the goal that I believe we share of building transparent, accountable, and effective law enforcement institutions and instead further erode police morale, community relationships, and public confidence, Hogan said in a statement. They will result in great damage to police recruitment and retention, posing significant risks to public safety throughout our state. State Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, a Democrat, hit back at Hogan in a tweet Friday, saying he doesnt stand with Black & Brown people in the state. He is telling Black Marylanders that systemic racism in policing doesn't exist here. SHAME ON HIM, Atterbeary said. He is telling my children & all other Black children in the state he does NOT care about their futures. SHAME ON HIM. SHAME ON HIM."

            "content": "NEW YORK  Leading mayoral candidate Andrew Yang responded to mounting criticism Saturday over remarks he made during his presidential campaign last year about abortion, when he said he fully supports womens reproductive rights but cautioned fellow Democrats against celebrating an abortion. Ive been a champion of womens reproductive rights from Day One because its the right thing to do on every level, Yang said Saturday when asked to respond to critics during a campaign event in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Politicians and opposing camps piled on Yang Friday night and Saturday morning over his answer to a question during an event in February 2020 when he joined fellow Democratic presidential candidates at a conference co-hosted by the Center for Reproductive Rights. During the 26-minute interview, Yang said womens reproductive rights are sacrosanct and should be protected at the highest levels. But when asked how he would win support for that stance from Americans uncomfortable with late-term abortions, Yang said Democrats have to get back to the point where no one is suggesting that we be celebrating an abortion at any point in the pregnancy. A one-minute clip of the segment, tweeted last year by a reporter at the event, started re-circulating on Twitter Friday night and drew withering attacks. WTF is this garbage??? Seriously. This is beyond the pale, former City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito tweeted. I have sole authority in all that pertains to my body INCLUDING choosing NOT to have children. Ain't nothing tragic about it dude. Ever. #MyBodyMyChoice. The clip doesnt include the question Yang was responding to when MSNBCs Stephanie Ruhle asked how he would try to win support for reproductive rights from people opposed to late-term abortions. Even people who are pro abortion rights  some arent that comfortable with this idea, Ruhle said. How are you sensitive to those people? How do you win their support while also taking the position that you do personally? Yang responded, Its a tragedy to me if someone decides that they dont want to have a child and theyre on the fence ... I mean its a very difficult personal decision and it should be something were very very sensitive to. He said emphasizing that message might win over people concerned with late-term abortions. I think that celebrating children, family  like these are universal human values, he said. And if we manage to lead on that and then say, 'But we also stand for womens reproductive rights,' I believe we can bring Americans closer together on a really, really important personal issue. Yang, a newcomer to city politics has consistently led polls in the eight-way Democratic primary thus far and his opponents have been stepping up their attacks in recent weeks. Rival campaigns and their allies seized on the 2020 comments this weekend as a vilification of women who choose to have an abortion. Fellow candidate Maya Wiley, while not mentioning Yang by name, tweeted Saturday: Political leaders should fight to expand access for those who need it, not make them feel convicted in the court of public opinion for taking control of their health & body. State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, who has endorsed Scott Stringers rival mayoral campaign, also lit into Yang, saying, Dont be one of those guyswhose words perpetuate misogyny by making women bad for celebrating their right to choose. Candidate Shaun Donovan's spokesperson, Jeremy Edwards, pointed to Yangs past appearances on right-leaning podcasts while he was drumming up attention for his presidential campaign. This is what happens when you spend a majority of your time on the right wing podcast circuityou eventually start parroting their talking points, he tweeted. And Melanie Roussell Newman, a senior vice president at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said: A tragedy to decide not to have children??? In 2021? In a global pandemic? In a global climate crisis? In a systemic racism crisis? People should be forced to have kids? No sir. Roussell, a former colleague of Donovan who has tweeted in support of his campaign, said she was voicing her own opinion  not that of Planned Parenthood. Yang reiterated Saturday that his stance on late-term abortion is the same as his stance on abortion in general. Im relatively absolutist on the fact that it should be up to a woman to decide what to do, he said. My stance on [late-term abortion] is identical  it should be up to a woman to determine what to do in concert with her physician. He dismissed the attacks from his opponents as a political tactic. I cant speak to why other campaigns do what they do, Yang said. I will say were focused on sending a positive message about where the city needs to go, and were focused on that every single day.

            "content": "At least 82 people were killed in one city Friday in a crackdown by Myanmar security forces on pro-democracy protesters, according to reports from independent local media and an organization that keeps track of casualties since the militarys February seizure of power. Fridays death toll in Bago was the biggest one-day total for a single city since March 14, when just over 100 people were killed in Yangon, the countrys biggest city. Bago is about 60 miles northeast of Yangon. The Associated Press is unable to independently verify the number of deaths. The death toll of 82 was a preliminary one compiled by the Assistance Assn. for Political Prisoners, which issues daily counts of casualties and arrests from the crackdown in the aftermath of the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Their tallies are widely accepted as highly credible. The community is planning counterprotests and pleading with public officials to do more to intervene in the face of white supremacists. In its Saturday report, the group said that it expected the number of dead in Bago to rise as more cases were verified. The online news site Myanmar Now also reported that 82 people had been killed, citing an unnamed source involved with charity rescue work. Myanmar Now and other local media said the bodies of the dead had been collected by the military and dumped on the grounds of a Buddhist pagoda. At least 701 protesters and bystanders have been killed by security forces since the armys takeover, according to the Assistance Assn. for Political Prisoners. The bloody crackdown in Bago was the third in the past week in which massive force was used against the persistent opposition to the ruling junta. Attacks were launched Wednesday on hardcore opponents of military rule who had set up strongholds in the towns of Kalay and Taze in the countrys north. In both places, at least 11 people  possibly including some bystanders  were reported killed. Security forces were accused of using heavy weapons in their attacks, including rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, though such allegations could not be independently confirmed by the AP. Photos posted on social media from Bago appeared to show fragments of mortar shells. Most protests in cities and towns around the country are carried out by nonviolent demonstrators who consider themselves part of a civil disobedience movement. But as the police and military escalated the use of lethal force, a more militant faction of protesters armed themselves with homemade weapons such as firebombs in the name of self-defense. In Kalay, activists dubbed themselves a civil army and some began carrying rudimentary hunting rifles that are traditional in the remote area. A Saturday report by Myanmar Now said residents of Tamu, a town in the same region as Kalay, used such rifles Saturday to ambush a military convoy, and claimed to kill three soldiers. The junta has taken other measures as well to discourage resistance. It recently published a list of 140 people active in the arts and journalism who are wanted for spreading information that undermines the stability of the country and the rule of law. The penalty for the offense is up to three years imprisonment. Arrests of those on the list have been highly publicized in state media. State television channel MRTV reported Friday night that a military court had sentenced to death 19 people  17 in absentia  for allegedly killing an army officer in Yangon on March 27. The attack took place in an area of the city that is under martial law, and the court action appeared to be the first time the death sentence has been imposed under the juntas rule. The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, arrived Friday in the Thai capital Bangkok on a regional mission to resolve the crisis in Myanmar, also known as Burma. She intends to sound out several Southeast Asian governments for their ideas but has been denied permission to visit Myanmar."

            "content": "The murder trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyds death has introduced viewers from around the world to a vast array of defense and prosecution tactics aimed at swaying the jury. Some strategies and terms that have become part of Derek Chauvins trial are rare outside criminal courtrooms. The Associated Press has taken closer looks into them to better explain what viewers are seeing and hearing. Video shows Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyds neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds on May 25. But defense attorneys are tasked with casting doubt on whether the former officer was directly responsible for the Black mans death. Theyve sought to argue that other factors, such as drug use, may have killed him. A medical examiner concluded last year that Floyds heart stopped, complicated by how police restrained him and compressed his neck. However, narrowed arteries, high blood pressure, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use also were listed on the death certificate as other contributing conditions. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker testified that those conditions didnt cause the death. Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. His lawyer, Eric Nelson, has argued that the officer followed his training and suggested that Floyd died due to use of illegal drugs and existing health conditions. Nelson has tried to play up Floyds drug use and sought to show Wednesday that Floyd yelled I ate too many drugs as officers pinned him down. Playing a short clip from a police body camera video, Nelson asked prosecution witness Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles Police Department sergeant who served as a prosecution use-of-force expert, if he heard Floyd say: I ate too many drugs. I cant make that out, Stiger replied. Nelson later replayed it for senior special agent James Reyerson with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, who agreed thats what Floyd appeared to say. But prosecutor Matthew Frank replayed a longer clip from the same body-camera video that put Floyds statement into broader context. Reyerson replied: I believe Mr. Floyd was saying, I aint do no drugs. Experts and other Minneapolis officers have testified that the force used to subdue and detain Floyd on the pavement was excessive. This past week, jurors were introduced to the concept of excited delirium, a term one of the officers at the scene is heard on police body camera asking as a panicked Floyd writhed and claimed to be claustrophobic as officers tried to put him in the squad car. One Minneapolis officer who trains others in medical care described the term on the stand as a combination of psychomotor agitation, psychosis, hypothermia, a wide variety of other things you might see in a person or rather bizarre behavior. An expert in forensic medicine who works as a police surgeon for the Louisville Metro Police Department in Kentucky and as a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Louisville testified Thursday that Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Extensive video evidence from surveillance cameras, cellphones and police body cameras of Floyds death may be the most critical part of the case for the defense and prosecution. Modern courtrooms, like the one where Chauvin is being tried, use such technology as large video screens, projectors and up-to-date software. Dr. Martin Tobin, a lung and critical care specialist at the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital and Loyola Universitys medical school in Illinois, used a computer animation to show how Floyd was held down on the pavement. It gave jurors a 360-degree view of where the officers were and what they were doing. He used a composite of pictures from a bystander video to show Chauvin pressing his knee to Floyds neck. Floyds respiratory distress was growing at that point as officers held him down on his stomach, with his hands handcuffed behind his back. The images showed how Floyd tried to use his shoulder muscles to draw breath, the doctor said."

            "content": "A second lieutenant in the U.S. Army is suing two Virginia police officers over a traffic stop in December during which the officers drew their guns, pointed them at him and used a slang term to suggest he was facing execution before pepper-spraying him and knocking him to the ground. Body camera video shows Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino, was dressed in uniform with his hands held in the air outside the drivers side window as he told the armed officers, Im honestly afraid to get out. Yeah, you should be! one of the officers responded during the stop at a gas station. In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Nazario says his constitutional rights were violated during the traffic stop in the town of Windsor. The two sides in the case dispute what happened after a second police officer joined the first one in the stop. At the time, Nazario was coming from his duty station and going home, attorney Jonathan Arthur told the Associated Press on Friday. Graduated from Virginia State University. He was commissioned out of their ROTC program. Hes an officer in the United States armed forces, Arthur said. These guys decide to do this to him. Asked about Nazarios condition after the incident, Arthur said, Hes definitely not doing too well. Windsor Police Officer Daniel Crocker radioed he was attempting to stop a vehicle with no rear license plate and tinted windows. He said the driver was eluding police and he considered it a high-risk traffic stop, according to a report he submitted afterward and which was included in the court filing. Arthur said Nazario explained at the time that he wasnt trying to elude the officer, but was trying to stop in a well-lighted area for officer safety and out of respect for the officers. Another officer, Joe Gutierrez, was driving by when he heard Crockers call, saw him attempting to stop the SUV and decided to join the traffic stop. Gutierrez acknowledged that Nazarios decision to drive to a lighted area happens to him a lot, and 80% of the time, its a minority, Arthur said, quoting the officer. The lawsuit says by the time the two officers reached Nazarios SUV, the license plate was visible in the rear. Nazario drove his SUV to a well-lighted gas station where, according to the lawsuit, the two officers got out and immediately drew their guns and pointed them at Nazario after they got out of their cars. The officers then attempted to pull Nazario out of the vehicle while he continued to keep his hands in the air. Gutierrez then stepped back and pepper-sprayed Nazario multiple times as officers yelled for him to get out of the car. I dont even want to reach for my seatbelt, can you please? ... My hands are out, can you please  look, this is really messed up, Nazario stammered upon being pepper-sprayed, his eyes clenched shut. The officers shouted conflicting orders at Nazario, telling him to put his hands out the window while also telling him to open the door and get out, the lawsuit says. At one point, Gutierrez told Nazario he was fixin to ride the lightning, a reference to the electric chair, which was also a line from the movie The Green Mile, a film about a Black man facing execution. Nazario got out of the vehicle and again asked for a supervisor. Gutierrez responded with knee-strikes to his legs, knocking him to the ground, the lawsuit says. The two officers struck him multiple times, then handcuffed and interrogated him. The traffic stop was captured on Nazarios cellphone video, and the body-worn cameras worn by Crocker and Gutierrez, according to the lawsuit. These cameras captured footage of behavior consistent with a disgusting nationwide trend of law enforcement officers, who, believing they can operate with complete impunity, engage in unprofessional, discourteous, racially biased, dangerous and sometimes deadly abuses of authority ... the lawsuit says. The AP reached out to Windsor police for comment, but an email was not returned and their voice mailbox was full. No one answered the phone at a number listed for Crocker on Friday. Crocker and Gutierrez still work for the department, the town manager told the Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk. Windsor is about 70 miles southeast of Richmond."

            "content": "Like others in her family, Mattie Pringle had doubts about taking the COVID-19 vaccine. The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, S.C., feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringles church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. Thats what made me change my mind, said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first COVID-19 shot Thursday. I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that. Of the 73 allegations of less serious force, 33 have been resolved by the department with zero resulting in a finding that officers were in the wrong. Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the U.S. are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Bidens administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24% of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. Thats down from 41% in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26% and Latinos at 22%. Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Assn., said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken almost a 180-degree turnaround as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organizers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 550,000 Americans. Its the messenger and the message, but the messenger is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasnt preachy, Benjamin said. They didnt tell people, You need to get vaccinated because its your duty. They basically said, Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family. Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr. Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on COVID-19, she said. Based on that relationship, people felt comfortable hearing from me, she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Ga., the Rev. John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots, said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perrys coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers  including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot  have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. Im thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I dont want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop, Pettibone said. But its the unknown. Everybodys really scared of the unknown. In Savannah, Ga., community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health. Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Ala., in which the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes. Sanders declined to say whether she was getting vaccinated. She said shes spoken with several people who had to be hospitalized with COVID-19 but still have doubts about the vaccines. Thats how skeptical people are, Sanders said. Theyre like, No, Ill fight it myself. I fought it already. P.M. Browner got her vaccine Wednesday in Clarksdale, Miss. The 88-year-old Black woman said she doesnt understand why she needs to get vaccinated if shes not sick or around sick people. Still, she agreed to get her shot. She said she thinks vaccinations will eventually be required, and she wants to be able to continue to socialize at a local senior center. If you aint got nothing, why do we need to take it? Browner said. But well take it because later on, theyll say, Youve got to take it. If you dont, later on, I think well have to."

            "content": "Britains Prince Charles offered a heartfelt tribute to his dear Papa, on Saturday as Buckingham Palace offered the broad outlines of a royal funeral that will be attended by the family and broadcast to the world. As Queen Elizabeth II and other relatives mourned, Charles offered a deeply personal video message saying the royal family was deeply grateful for the outpouring of support theyve received following the death Friday of his 99-year-old father, Prince Philip. My dear Papa was a very special person who I think, above all else, would have been amazed by the reaction and the touching things that have been said about him, Charles said from his southwestern England home of Highgrove. And from that point of view we are, my family, deeply grateful for all that. It will sustain us in this particular loss and at this particularly sad time. Philips royal ceremonial funeral will take place April 17 at Windsor Castle  a slimmed-down service amid the COVID-19 pandemic that will be entirely closed to the public. The palace insisted the royals would strictly adhere to national virus guidelines, measures that in theory would entail mask wearing in an enclosed space and social distancing. The palace declined to comment on specifics. Philip, the queens husband of 73 years who was also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, took part in planning his own funeral and its focus on family will be in accordance with his wishes. The duke also took part in designing the modified Land Rover that will carry his coffin. Although the ceremonial arrangements are reduced, the occasion will still celebrate and recognize the dukes life and his more than 70 years of service to the queen, the U.K. and the commonwealth, a palace spokesman said Saturday while speaking on condition of anonymity in line with policy. Prince Harry, Philips grandson who stepped away from royal duties last year and now lives in California, will attend the service at Windsor along with other members of the royal family. His wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, has been advised by her doctor not to make the long journey. The palace appealed to the public not to gather in Windsor and for those who wished to pay their respects to Philip to stay home instead. The announcement came after military teams across the U.K. and on ships at sea fired 41-gun salutes Saturday to mark Philips death, honoring the former naval officer whom they considered one of their own. Batteries in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast  the respective capitals of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the four nations that make up the United Kingdom  as well as other cities around the U.K. and the Mediterranean outpost of Gibraltar fired the volleys at one-minute intervals beginning at midday. Warships including the Montrose, a frigate patrolling the Persian Gulf, offered their own salutes. The Duke of Edinburgh served among us during the Second World War, and he remained devoted to the Royal Navy and the Armed Forces as a whole, Gen. Nick Carter, chief of the defense staff, said in a statement. A life well-lived. His Royal Highness leaves us with a legacy of indomitable spirit, steadfastness and an unshakeable sense of duty. Members of the Commonwealth of Nations, a group of 54 countries headed by the monarch, were also invited to honor Philip. The Australian military began its salute at 5 p.m. local time in Canberra, and New Zealand planned to offer its own tribute on Sunday. Philip joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1939 and once had a promising military career. In 1941, he was honored for his service during the battle of Cape Matapan off the coast of Greece, when his control of searchlights aboard the battleship Valiant allowed it to pinpoint enemy vessels in the dark. Philip rose to the rank of commander before he retired from active duty. Two years after the war ended, Philip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey when she was 21 and he was 26. Philips naval career came to an abrupt end when King George VI died in 1952 and his wife became queen. At the queens coronation in 1953, Philip swore to be his wifes liege man of life and limb and settled into a life supporting the monarch. The couple had four children  Charles, the heir to the throne, Anne, Andrew and Edward. Before he retired from official duties in 2017, the prince carried out more than 22,000 solo public engagements and supported over 780 organizations, including the Duke of Edinburghs Award for young people. Members of the public continued to honor Philips life of service on Saturday, leaving flowers outside Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle despite appeals from authorities. I think everyone would like to pay their respects, Maureen Field, 67, said outside Windsor Castle. Because of the virus, a lot of people have to stay away. He didnt want a big funeral. He wanted a very private time with his family to say their goodbyes. So, weve all got to respect that. Mike Williams, 50, traveled from his home in Surrey, southwest of London, to Buckingham Palace to honor the prince. Hes a massive loss to the country and to the world, I think, so we wanted to come and pay respects, Williams said. I dont know what it achieves, but it just felt like the right thing to do."

            "content": "Voters go to the polls Sunday to elect new presidents in two neighboring South American nations  Ecuador and Peru  that have been battered by the pandemic, economic contractions and political turmoil. In both Andean countries, polls have shown widespread dissatisfaction with leadership failures to stem rising unemployment and poverty, much of it fallout from the COVID-19 crisis  which has hit Latin America especially hard, causing social and economic devastation across the region. Ecuador and Peru have also both seen recent surges in coronavirus cases, slow vaccine rollouts and scandals involving politically connected individuals receiving inoculations before their turn. Ecuadoreans will cast ballots in a contentious runoff vote featuring two ideological divergent candidates  Andrs Arauz, 36, a left-wing economist, and Guillermo Lasso, 65, a conservative businessman. They were the top two finishers in hotly disputed initial balloting in February. Incumbent Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno is not seeking reelection. The mother of the children, 30-year-old Liliana Carrillo, was taken into custody in Tulare County after fleeing the scene. Peruvians will select from a fragmented field of more than a dozen presidential aspirants who span the ideological spectrum, from far left to hard right. No candidate in Peru is expected to win a majority, probably forcing a June runoff between the two highest vote-getters. Perus current president, Francisco Sagasti, is not on the ballot. He took office in November as a caretaker leader after a political crisis saw the country go through three presidents in a week. In Ecuador, recent polls have shown a narrowing lead for Arauz, a protege of former President Rafael Correa, a leftist sentenced to prison for corruption who fled to Belgium. Correa, who remains a divisive figure here, has denied the allegations and called them politically motivated. The race in Ecuador has become a kind of referendum on whether free-market principles or leftist-style social spending is the best remedy for the countrys economic woes. Arauzs side has portrayed Lasso as a tool of big business, while Lasso backers call Arauz the embodiment of a failed socialist vision. Arauz finished first in the initial round of voting with promises to bolster payouts and other support for the hard-hit poor and working classes. In recent weeks, Lasso has sought to temper his conservative banker image with vows to help the poor and increase environmental protections, while stressing the need for foreign investment and pro-market reforms. More than a quarter of Ecuadorean voters remained undecided or plan to submit blank or spoiled ballots (damaged or marking multiple candidates), polls show. That indicates a broad discontent about the direction of the nation of 17 million. Slumping prices for oil, Ecuadors chief export, have contributed to the countrys economic woes. Many voters are edgy about the future. I dont feel that either of the candidates represents me  both make me nervous, said Alexandra Muoz, 43, an economist in Quito, the capital. The middle class has been ravaged. Allegations of fraud marred Februarys initial round of balloting. Such charges are also expected to follow Sundays election, whatever the result, observers say. It has been a campaign with attacks from both sides, said Santiago Basabe, a political analyst in Quito. Most of them unjustified. Yaku Prez, an Indigenous activist who narrowly missed a spot in the presidential runoff and alleged widespread fraud, has called on his supporters to file spoiled ballots. Arauzs backers have accused Lassos camp of smearing him as a radical socialist who would turn Ecuador into a Venezuelan-style economic basket case and abandon the U.S. dollar as the nations currency. Arauz has denied the charges and portrayed himself as a moderate, but some voters are skeptical. My fear is that we will become another Venezuela if Arauz is elected, said Francisco Vzquez, 41, a publicist in Quito who plans to vote for Lasso. We need a secure situation to advance, to work. Many supporters of Arauz call Lasso a surrogate for banks and international capital who has little feel for the difficult lives facing most Ecuadoreans. His election, they say, would only exacerbate the countrys deep inequalities. Arauz will fight against monopolies and work for productivity, not only for big business, but also for small and medium sectors of the economy, said Mauricio Galindo, 45, a historian and Arauz supporter. That is the productive base of our country. Ecuadors new president is to take office in May for a four-year term. Times staff writer McDonnell reported from Mexico City and special correspondent Jaramillo Viteri from Quito. Special correspondent Adriana Len in Lima contributed to this report."

            "content": "From a secure room in the Capitol on Jan. 6, as rioters pummeled police and vandalized the building, Vice President Mike Pence tried to assert control. In an urgent phone call to the acting Defense secretary, he issued a startling demand. Clear the Capitol, Pence said. Elsewhere in the building, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) were making a similarly dire appeal to military leaders. We need help, Schumer said in desperation, more than an hour after the Senate chamber had been breached. At the Pentagon, officials were discussing media reports that the mayhem was not confined to Washington and that other state capitals were facing similar violence in what had the makings of a national insurrection. We must establish order, said Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a call with Pentagon leaders. But order would not be restored for hours. These new details from the deadly riot of Jan. 6 during the congressional certification of Joe Bidens election victory are contained in a previously undisclosed document prepared by the Pentagon for internal use that was obtained by the Associated Press and vetted by current and former government officials. The timeline adds another layer of understanding about the state of fear and panic while the insurrection played out, and lays bare the inaction by then-President Trump and how that void contributed to a slowed response by the military and law enforcement. It shows that the intelligence missteps, tactical errors and bureaucratic delays were eclipsed by governments failure to comprehend the scale and intensity of a violent uprising by its own citizens. Uncharted waters. Judges are banning some Capitol riot suspects from the internet Social media was key to the Capitol riot. Now courts are struggling with whether suspects should be banned from using the internet. With Trump not engaged, it fell to Pentagon officials, a handful of senior White House aides, the leaders of Congress and the vice president, holed up in a secure bunker, to manage the chaos. At 4:08 p.m. on Jan. 6, as the rioters roamed the Capitol, and after they had menacingly called out for Pelosi and yelled for Pence to be hanged, the vice president was in a protected location, calling Christopher Miller, the acting Defense secretary, and demanding answers. The call lasted a minute. Pence said the Capitol was not secure, and he asked military leaders for a deadline for securing the building, according to the document. Government leaders had talked about the use of the National Guard just three days earlier. On the afternoon of Jan. 3, Miller and Milley gathered with other Cabinet members to talk about Jan. 6. They also met with Trump. In that meeting at the White House, Trump approved the activation of the Washington, D.C., National Guard and told the acting Defense secretary to take whatever action was needed as events unfolded, according to the information obtained by the AP. The Guards role was limited to traffic intersections and checkpoints around the city, based in part on strict restrictions mandated by D.C. officials. Miller also authorized Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to deploy, if needed, the D.C. Guards emergency reaction force stationed at Joint Base Andrews. The Trump administration and the Pentagon were wary of a heavy military presence, in part because of criticism officials faced for the seemingly heavy-handed National Guard and law enforcement efforts to counter civil unrest in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. By the morning of Jan. 6, crowds started gathering at the Ellipse near the White House before Trumps speech. According to the Pentagons plans, the acting Defense secretary would be notified only if the crowd swelled beyond 20,000. Before long it was clear the crowd was far more in control of events than the troops and law enforcement there to maintain order. Photos: Trump supporters turn violent, storm U.S. Capitol Trump supporters gather in the U.S. capital to protest the ratification of President-elect Joe Bidens electoral college victory over President Trump. Trump, just before noon, told his supporters to march to the Capitol. The crowd size at the rally was at least 10,000. By 1:15 p.m., the procession was on the move. As the protesters reached the Capitol grounds, some immediately became violent, busting through weak police barriers in front of the building and beating up Capitol Police officers who stood in their way. At 1:49 p.m., then-Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund called Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, to request assistance. Twenty minutes later, around 2:10 p.m., the first rioters were beginning to break through the doors and windows of the Senate. Sund called Walker again and asked for at least 200 guardsmen, and to send more if they are available. On the Pentagons third floor E Ring, senior Army leaders were huddled around the phone for what they described as a panicked call from the D.C. Guard. As the gravity of the situation became clear, McCarthy bolted from the meeting, sprinting down the hall to Millers office and breaking into a meeting. Shortly after 3 p.m., the Army secretary provided verbal approval of the activation of 1,100 National Guard troops to support the D.C. police, and the development of a plan for the troops deployment duties, locations and unit sizes. But they struggled over the next 90 minutes to execute the plan as the Army and Guard called all troops in from their checkpoints, issued them new gear, laid out a new plan for their mission and briefed them on their duties. At 3:19 p.m., Pelosi and Schumer were calling the Pentagon for help and were told the National Guard had been approved. At 3:48 p.m., frustrated that the D.C. Guard hadnt fully developed a plan to link up with police, McCarthy dashed from the Pentagon to D.C. police headquarters to help coordinate with law enforcement. Trump broke his silence at 4:17 p.m., tweeting to his followers to go home and go in peace. By about 4:30 p.m., the militarys response plan was finalized and Walker had approval to send the Guard to the Capitol. Dressed in full riot gear, the Guard began arriving at the Capitol at 5:20 p.m. At 8 p.m. the Capitol was declared secure."

            "content": "After a deadly year in New Yorks nursing homes, state lawmakers have passed legislation intended to hold facility operators more accountable for neglect and potentially force them to spend more on patient care. Rules passed in recent days as part of a state budget deal would require for-profit homes to spend at least 70% of their revenue on direct patient care, including 40% on staff who work directly with residents. Under the deal, set to be signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, home operators will also face limits on their profit margins. Any profits in excess of 5% would have to be sent to the state. The goal here is to not only protect people in nursing homes, but to [also] dissuade bad actors from coming into this business, state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, chair of the Senate Health Committee, said. New Yorks budget would also send $64 million to nursing homes and acute care facilities to increase nurse staffing levels. Transit ridership and public school enrollment will need a boost after the pandemic, plus more from the week in Opinion. The nursing home industry has blasted the new revenue requirements, saying operators need flexibility for things like construction costs. Stephen Hanse, president and chief executive of the New York State Health Facilities Assn., which represents nursing homes, said the big problem in the industry isnt owner greed, but poor reimbursement rates for care. He said it costs $266 per day on average to provide skilled nursing care for a resident, but New York pays an average of $211. The states new spending mandate, he said, harms the highest quality, fully staffed four- and five- star nursing homes by requiring that funds be redirected from other patient care investments and building improvements and be used only for certain staff. More long-term care residents have died of COVID-19 in New York than any other state. Nursing homes alone have reported 13,800 deaths. The Cuomo administrations decision to withhold information from the public for months about those deaths is being investigated by federal prosecutors and is one subject of a legislative impeachment inquiry. Cuomo and lawmakers are also facing outcry from family members devastated by the states high death toll and worries that residents, despite an ongoing vaccination campaign, are still at risk in some understaffed facilities. I had absolutely no idea this was how this nursing home industry was run until I had to deal with it, said Cecelia Potter, 63, of Cobleskill, whose 74-year-old husband is in a central New York nursing home. Potter said her husband, a Navy veteran, hasnt showered in weeks, receives little attention from overstretched aides and has declined dramatically over the past year. She said she has seen the owner of her husbands nursing home driving fancy cars, and wants to know how much money he makes from residents whose care is largely funded by Medicaid. We need massive nursing home reform, statewide we do, and its probably countrywide, she said. Just simply because these people that own these places are allowed to get away with a lot. They shouldnt be. This is our most vulnerable population. One new law, signed by Cuomo this week, repeals a legal shield that protected nursing homes from some lawsuits during the COVID-19 pandemic. New Yorks law was among the nations most protective, and state Atty. Gen. Letitia James called for lawmakers to repeal it in January. What immunity provision did is give a green light to facilities to engage in practices and staffing patterns known to create unreasonable risk to residents, Syracuse University law professor Nina Kohn said. The immunity repeal doesnt explicitly allow family members to sue for substandard care during the months of the pandemic when the shield was in place  a right advocates for the elderly had pushed for. But lawmakers hope their efforts could help families who try to sue anyway. New Yorks new rules requiring 70% of a nursing homes revenues to be used for patient care sets a lower bar than some states. New Jersey requires that at least 90% of revenues be spent on patient care. But significant numbers of nursing homes are spending 50% and 60% of their revenue on care and services for the residents, according to Assembly member Richard Gottfried, a New York City Democrat and Assembly Health Committee chair. Until now there were almost no rules, Gottfried said. So if they were siphoning off money, even when you prove that, it didnt have any consequences. The new system will require enforcement. It will require the Health Department or if necessary the state attorney general or comptroller, to audit the data and make sure that money is really being spent where the owner claims it is being spent. Meanwhile, some family members and attorneys worry that for-profit nursing home operators will find ways around the revenue restrictions. About two-thirds of New Yorks nursing homes are for-profit. John Dalli, an attorney who focuses on elder abuse and nursing home negligence, said the revenue cap doesnt, for example, prevent nursing home operators from doing business with related companies who may own the building they rent. I am skeptical about whether this cap will have any real effect on the ultimate profits that flow through to these operators and their families, Dalli said."

            "content": "An ardent abortion foe who once opposed allowing gay couples to be foster parents, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is the unlikeliest figure to complain about bills on the culture wars reaching his desk. But by vetoing a ban on gender confirming treatments for transgender youth, the Republican offered a rare rebuke to fellow conservatives who have been in overdrive this legislative session with bills expanding gun rights and restricting LGBTQ and abortion rights. I was told this week that the nation is looking at Arkansas because I have on my desk another bill passed by the General Assembly that is a product of the cultural war in America, Hutchinson said as he announced his decision. I dont shy away from the battle when it is necessary and defensible, but the most recent action of the General Assembly, while well-intended, is off-course. Even for veterans of the culture wars like Hutchinson, this year has been a jarring one in Republican-controlled statehouses from South Carolina to South Dakota. Fueled by an influx of hard-right lawmakers echoing former President Trump and the backing of outside groups, Republican legislatures are pushing the bounds in already deeply Republican states on issues such as gun rights, access to abortions, and increasingly, protections for transgender people. Citing religious freedom, Santa Clara County residents objected to state restrictions on Bible study gatherings in homes. The Supreme Court agreed. The bills reflect the larger mood of the Republican Party, which nationally has struggled to define Democrats in the post-Trump era. Instead, the focus has been on issues that drive the partys base and that Republicans use to portray Democrats as out of touch with average Americans. Republicans frustration with an inability to move policy at a federal level trickles down to more action in the states, Republican strategist Alex Conant said. I think a lot of these state legislatures are responding to the demands of the conservative base, which sees the culture wars headed in the wrong direction nationally. Few are going further to the right than Arkansas, where Hutchinson over the last several weeks has signed bills restricting rights for transgender people, banning almost all abortions in the state, and easing restrictions on the use of deadly force in self-defense in the so-called stand your ground law. The bills faced little to no resistance in the Legislature. The conservative bent of this legislature is just so overwhelming that theres not any guardrails, said Sen. Keith Ingram, the top Democrat in Arkansas Senate. Some of the measures Republicans are pushing in the country expand on longtime party priorities. Encouraged by Trumps three appointments to the Supreme Court, GOP lawmakers have moved beyond incremental abortion restrictions and are instead trying to enact outright bans like Arkansas has. Thirty-one such bans have been proposed in 15 states this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. The number of anti-abortion bills being considered in Oklahoma has nearly doubled over the last three years. South Carolinas Republican governor signed a measure banning nearly all abortions, a measure that was immediately blocked due to a legal challenge. Efforts to expand gun rights are also advancing in Republican states that already have few restrictions, with GOP lawmakers citing fears of new gun control measures under President Bidens administration. Hutchinson in February signed a stand your ground law loosening restrictions on the use of deadly force in self-defense, a proposal that had stalled in past years. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee last week signed a law allowing most adults 21 and older to carry handguns without a background check or training. The new fronts include record numbers of voting restrictions fueled by Trumps unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020. A sweeping new voting law in Georgia prompted pushback from major corporations and even led to Major League Baseball pulling the All-Star Game out of Atlanta. The Human Rights Campaign, the nations largest LGBTQ rights group, said its been alarmed by the record number of bills imposing restrictions on transgender people. More than 100 such bills have been filed so far this year, the group said. At least 20 states are considering treatment bans similar to Arkansas. GOP leaders say the bills in some cases reflect lawmakers catching up on sessions cut short last year due to COVID-19, but also constituents desires. Thats the direction that Tennessee is wanting to move, based on the people they elected, said Cameron Sexton, the House speaker in Tennessee, where the flood of advancing bills includes an effort to make the Bible the states official book. The agenda for Arkansas House and Senate on any given day this year looks like a social conservatives dream. Other bills working their way through the Legislature include one allowing schools to teach creationism and one prohibiting police from enforcing federal gun laws. The flood of bills is even too much for Hutchinson. A longtime figure in the states Republican politics, Hutchinson is a former congressman who called for reinstating the states ban on gay foster parents when he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2006. Since taking office in 2015, hes signed some of the strictest abortion restrictions in the country. A day after he vetoed the transgender treatment ban, Republican lawmakers overrode him and enacted it anyway. Hutchinson signed the abortion ban despite his concerns about its constitutionality, and lack of the rape and incest exceptions. He signed the stand your ground legislation despite past reservations about changes to the states self-defense law. Conservatives have also dramatically scaled back Hutchinsons goal of passing a hate crimes bill this year. Theyre advancing instead a class protection bill that doesnt refer specifically to categories such as race, sexual orientation or gender identity. The governor has said he supports the measure, though he acknowledges it wasnt his first choice. Arkansas Republicans say the bills show the shift further to the right in the state, which Trump easily won in 2016 and last year. Republicans also expanded their majorities in both chambers of the Arkansas Legislature last year. After years of being told, this isnt what people want, this will hurt us, well lose an election, were actually seeing the opposite being true, Republican Sen. Trent Garner said. The tone of the debate over the transgender measures is worrying opponents, especially healthcare professionals who have warned that the steps are marginalizing people already at high risk of bullying and suicide. At one point during a debate on one of the transgender measures in Arkansas, a Republican lawmaker cited a Bible verse that called people who wear another genders clothes an abomination. Another compared parental acceptance of transgender youth to allowing a child to decide to become a cow. I grew up in a state that I didnt feel like was legislating hate against me, said Rep. Tippi McCullough, the top Democrat in the Arkansas House and the only openly gay member of the state Legislature. Hutchinsons stance against the treatment ban earned him the ire of Trump, who called the governor a lightweight RINO, meaning Republican in name only. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential 2024 presidential hopeful whos tried to align herself with Trump, faced similar conservative backlash after reversing course on a transgender sports ban. Noem initially said she planned to sign the measure, then partially vetoed it and later issued an order that pushed schools to issue bans. Noem has promised to call a special legislative session this year to have lawmakers take up the issue again. Hutchinson said he doesnt regret the other transgender restrictions hes signed and isnt backing off his support for restricting abortion. But he said he hoped his veto would cause fellow Republicans to consider restraint on some social issues. Sometimes youve got to pull back and say, is this really the role of the state? Hutchinson told reporters. Is this really reflecting confidence in parents and doctors to make good decisions?"

            "content": "A strong earthquake killed at least eight people, injured 23 others and damaged more than 300 buildings on Indonesias main island of Java and was also felt on the tourist hotspot of Bali, officials said Saturday. No tsunami warnings were posted. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 6.0 quake struck off the islands southern coast at 2:00 p.m. local time. It was centered 28 miles south of the town of Sumberpucung in the Malang district of East Java province, at a depth of 51 miles. Rahmat Triyono, the head of Indonesias earthquake and tsunami center, said in a statement the undersea temblor did not have the potential to cause a tsunami. Still, he urged people to stay away from slopes of soil or rocks that have the potential for landslides. This was the second deadly disaster to hit Indonesia this week, after a severe downpour Sunday triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja killed at least 174 people and left 48 still missing while damaging thousands of houses. Some victims were buried in either mudslides or solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November, while others were swept away by flash flooding. Saturdays quake caused falling rocks to kill a woman on a motorcycle and badly injured her husband in East Javas Lumajang district, said Raditya Jati, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. He said dozens of homes were damaged across the district, and rescuers had retrieved two bodies from under the rubble in Kali Uling village. Two people were also confirmed killed in an area bordering Lumajang and Malang districts, while one person was found dead under rubble in Malang. Television reports showed people running in panic from malls and buildings in several cities in East Java province. Indonesias search and rescue agency released videos and photos of damaged houses and buildings, including a ceiling at a hospital in Blitar, a city neighboring Malang. Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas. Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 270 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In January, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake killed at least 105 people and injured nearly 6,500, while more than 92,000 displaced, after striking Mamuju and Majene districts in West Sulawesi province."

Credit: Howard Schnapp Students can now sit 3 feet rather than 6 feet apart in school classrooms, new state Department of Health guidance says. The new recommendations, released quietly on Friday and in effect immediately, leave the decision on whether to reduce the distance to school districts. Before making a change, each district or school  private schools also are covered by the guidelines  must get input from parents, community members, health departments, teachers and staff, the state health department said. Three weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released similar recommendations. Rhonda Taylor, the acting superintendent for the Uniondale Union Free School District, says she is \"really excited the state has caught up with the science that is showing that as long as were able to maintain a level of control in the classroom, that we can go to 3 feet and thereby bring more kids back. Our aim has always been to bring more kids back into the school, but safely.\" Most parents in Uniondale who have had the option for in-person instruction have kept their children with remote learning, though more have been sending their children into school buildings as vaccinations have ramped up, and that's a trend Taylor expects to continue. Many children feel isolated learning via computer, she said. \"In-person instruction is the best mode of instruction for our scholars,\" Taylor said.

Bill Heidenreich, superintendent of the Valley Stream Central High School District, said his schools now have enough space to keep desks 6 feet apart, but as more parents are comfortable with in-person instruction for their children, that could change. Heidenreich, president of the Nassau County Council of School Superintendents, predicted districts would hear a range of opinions from parents, with some supporting moving to 3 feet and others saying theyd pull their kids out of the classroom and return to remote learning if students sat closer together. \"Whether or not districts move from 6 feet to 3 feet is going to vary from community to community,\" he said. Last month, Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said the Nassau health department backed the CDC's 3-foot guidance. In a statement Saturday, Nassau spokeswoman Christine Geed said, \"The Department of Health just received this new New York State guidance and is currently reviewing it.\" Suffolk County officials did not respond to requests for comment. The state guidance says the one exception to the 3-foot rule is for middle and high schools in counties \"with high risk of transmission,\" when students must be 6 feet apart unless the same group of students is together all day. In addition, children must remain 6 feet apart when eating or drinking, and teachers must be 6 feet apart when interacting with each other. The requirement for masks and temperature checks will remain, the state said. As school officials reacted to the new rules, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's office said the states 7-day coronavirus test positivity rate declined slightly on Friday, from 3.37% to 3.31%. Long Island again had the second highest rate of the states 10 regions: 4.05%. Fifty-seven New Yorkers  including five in Suffolk and two in Nassau  died of COVID-19 on Friday. Hospitalizations fell Friday to 4,241, the lowest statewide total since Dec. 3. Of the 7,283 positive test results statewide, 619 were in Suffolk and 556 were in Nassau. The state reported that more than 280,000 vaccine doses were administered between Thursday and Friday mornings, bringing the total to more than 11.6 million. Statewide, 36.9% of New Yorkers have received at least one dose, and 23.9% are fully vaccinated. Sign up for COVID-19 text alerts at newsday.com/text David Olson covers health care.

            "content": "People stroll on The Long Walk towards Windsor Castle in Windsor, England on Saturday. Credit: AP/Frank Augstein LONDON  Prince Philips royal ceremonial funeral will take place April 17 at Windsor Castle  a slimmed-down service amid the COVID-19 pandemic that will be entirely closed to the public. Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, took part in planning his funeral and its focus on family was in accordance with his wishes. The 99-year-old duke, who died Friday, also took part in designing the modified Land Rover that will carry his coffin. \"Although the ceremonial arrangements are reduced, the occasion will still celebrate and recognize the dukes life and his more than 70 years of service to the Queen, the UK and the Commonwealth,\" a palace spokesman said Saturday while speaking on condition of anonymity in line with policy. Prince Harry, Philip's grandson who stepped away from royal duties last year and now lives in California, will attend the service along with other members of the royal family. His wife, the duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, has been advised by her doctor not to attend. Palace officials said the ceremony would be conducted strictly in line with the British government's COVID-19 guidelines, which restrict the number of people attending funerals to 30. They declined to say whether the royal family would be required to wear masks. The palace appealed to the public not to gather in Windsor, and for those who wished to pay their respects to Philips to stay at home instead. \"While there is sadness that the public will not be able to physically be part of events to commemorate the life of the duke, the royal family asks that anyone wishing to express their condolences do so in the safest way possible and not by visiting Windsor or any other royal palaces to pay their respects,'' the palace spokesman said. \"The familys wish is very much that people continue to follow the guidelines to keep themselves and others safe.'' The announcement comes after military teams across the U.K. and on ships at sea fired 41-gun salutes Saturday to mark the death of Philip, honoring the former naval officer and husband of Queen Elizabeth II whom they considered one of their own. Batteries in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast  the capitals of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom  as well as other cities around the U.K. and the Mediterranean outpost of Gibraltar fired the volleys at one-minute intervals beginning at midday. Ships including the HMS Montrose, a frigate patrolling the Persian Gulf, offered their own salutes. \"The Duke of Edinburgh served among us during the Second World War, and he remained devoted to the Royal Navy and the Armed Forces as a whole,\" Gen. Nick Carter, chief of the defense staff, said in a statement. \"A life well-lived. His Royal Highness leaves us with a legacy of indomitable spirit, steadfastness and an unshakeable sense of duty.\" Members of the Commonwealth, a group of 54 countries headed by the monarch, were also invited to honor Philip. The Australian Defense Force began its salute at 5 p.m. local time outside Parliament House in Canberra, and New Zealand planned to offer its own tribute on Sunday. Philip joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1939 and once had a promising military career. In 1941, he was honored for his service during the battle of Cape Matapan off the coast of Greece, when his control of searchlights aboard the HMS Valiant allowed the battleship to pinpoint enemy vessels in the dark. Philip rose to the rank of commander before he retired from active duty. Two years after the war ended, Philip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey when she was 21 and he was 26. Philips naval career came to an abrupt end when King George VI died in 1952 and his wife became queen. At the queens coronation in 1953, Philip swore to be his wifes \"liege man of life and limb\" and settled into a life supporting the monarch. The couple had four children  Charles, the heir to the throne, Anne, Andrew and Edward. Before he retired from official duties in 2017, the prince carried out more than 22,000 solo public engagements and supported over 780 organizations, including the Duke of Edinburghs Award for young people. Members of the public continued to honor Philips life of service on Saturday, leaving flowers outside Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle despite appeals from authorities and the royal family to refrain from gathering. \"I think everyone would like to pay their respects,\" Maureen Field, 67, said outside Windsor Castle. \"Because of the virus, a lot of people have to stay away. He didnt want a big funeral. He wanted a very private time with his family to say their goodbyes. So, weve all got to respect that.\" Mike Williams, 50, traveled from his home in Surrey, southwest of London, to Buckingham Palace to honor the prince. \"Hes a massive loss to the country and to the world, I think, so we wanted to come and pay respects,\" Williams said. \"I dont know what it achieves, but it just felt like the right thing to do.\""

            "content": "Congressman Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., speaks at \"Women for American First\" event on Friday in Doral, Fla. Credit: AP/Marta Lavandier WASHINGTON  The House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as federal prosecutors probing sex trafficking allegations against him are also scrutinizing the actions of some of his political allies and fellow Florida Republicans as part of a broader public corruption inquiry. Federal agents have, in recent months, been examining Gaetzs connections to several other influential Florida political figures. They include Florida state senator Jason Brodeur; Halsey Beshears, the states former top business regulator; Chris Dorworth, a lobbyist who had served in the state House of Representatives; and Jason Pirozzolo, a hand surgeon and Gaetz campaign donor who served on the board of the Orlando Airport Authority, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Brodeur and Beshears did not respond to repeated calls Friday seeking comment. An attorney for Pirozzolo also did not respond to a request for comment. Dorworth didn't comment. The FBIs examination of a wide range of topics involving Gaetz and his associates exemplifies the breadth of the investigation. Gaetz, who has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, has retained two prominent New York attorneys while facing a Justice Department investigation into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls. The scrutiny includes an examination of a trip that Gaetz and Pirozzolo took to the Bahamas with a group of women, and federal agents are looking into whether they were paid or received gifts to have sex with the men, the person said. CBS News first reported details of the trip. The FBI has also started questioning people about that trip and others that Gaetz and his associates took with women, and agents are examining whether any of the women were later hired into government positions as political favors, the person said. Investigators have been scrutinizing financial records, contact witnesses, former staff members and others who they believe may have been aware of the activities, according to the person. The person could not publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Gaetz has not been charged with a crime and has sent fundraising appeals that portray him as a victim of a \"smear campaign.\" During a high-profile appearance Friday night at former President Donald Trumps Doral golf club in Miami, he vowed, \"I have not yet begun to fight.\" \"Im built for the battle and Im not going anywhere,\" Gaetz said. \"The smears against me range from distortions of my personal life to wild  and I mean wild  conspiracy theories.\" But a potentially ominous sign occurred in a Florida court Thursday when it was revealed that a Gaetz associate, Joel Greenberg, a former county tax collector, is working toward a plea deal. Such a move could potentially open the door for Greenbergs cooperation against Gaetz. Prosecutors are examining whether Gaetz and Greenberg paid underage girls or offered them gifts in exchange for sex, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they could not discuss details publicly. Greenberg entered a not guilty plea Friday through his attorney to a variety of charges ranging from child sex trafficking to fraud. A judge has set a May 15 deadline for Greenberg to reach a plea deal. The House panels bipartisan probe is one of the first official indications Gaetzs party leaders are willing to scrutinize his actions. It also appears sweeping in scope, reaching beyond the reports of sexual misconduct into broader allegations of public corruption, according to the committee chairman, Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and ranking Republican Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana. Unfolding alongside a federal criminal investigation, the ethics probe ensures Gaetz will have to confront simultaneous inquiries even as he maintains his innocence and plans to remain in Congress. The Ethics Committee conducts its work in secret and usually issues a final report on what it finds, often many months later. Punishment for ethics violations is up to the House and can include censure, fines and even expulsion from Congress. Separately Friday, a spokesperson for Gaetz said attorneys Marc Mukasey and Isabelle Kirshner will lead his legal team. \"Matt has always been a fighter. A fighter for his constituents, a fighter for the country, and a fighter for the Constitution. Hes going to fight back against the unfounded allegations against him,\" the statement said, adding that the lawyers \"will take the fight to those trying to smear his name with falsehoods.\""

            "content": "A crew of young people on a lifelong expedition to colonize a distant planet grow frustrated with their rigidly controlled existence and begin to rebel, putting the mission at risk, in Voyagers. Director Neil Burger's (Limitless) new film is part classic space epic, part mystery, and part dark psychological thriller. All those elements serve as a framework to explore questions of morality, freedom, power, and the fundamental core of human nature. (Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.) Burger was inspired by two vivid mental images. \"The first was a group of young people sitting around inside a spaceship,\" he said. \"They were disheveled, zoned out, and looking like predators resting after a hunt. I don't know where that image came from. But the second [image] implied a story: that same group of people chasing another crew member down the narrow corridor of the ship, pursuing him like an animal.\" Burger sensed there was a meaningful story there and shaped his film around the ship as metaphor for our own world. He also researched the science of long-distance space exploration and on human behavior, most notably the effects of prolonged confinement, aggression, tribalism, and violence. The result is Voyagers. With the future of the human race at stake, a group of young men and women, bred for intelligence and obedience, embark on an expedition to colonize a distant planet. But when they uncover disturbing secrets about the mission, they defy their training and begin to explore their most primitive natures. As life on the ship descends into chaos, they're consumed by fear, lust, and the insatiable hunger for power. In the year 2063, scientists have discovered a new, habitable exoplanet where the human race could flourish, as Earth is fast becoming uninhabitable. Richard Alling (Colin Farrell, Minority Report, Artemis Fowl) is charged with raising a crop of designer babies to serve as the crew aboard the spaceship, Humanitas. Their voyage will take 86 years, meaning it is their grandchildren who will ultimately reach their new planetary home. So the children are raised and trained in isolated conditions that mimic those they will experience on the Humanitas. Alling grows attached and opts to join them on the mission, even though he won't live to see its end. Ten years in, the crew have matured into young adults, dutifully performing their assigned tasks and taking their daily \"vitamin supplement,\" dubbed the Blue. Then Christopher (Tye Sheridan, Ready Player One) discovers a strange toxin in the irrigation water aboard the ship and realizes it's coming from the crew's urine. Specifically, it's an ingredient in the Blue, designed to subdue the personality and decrease pleasurable response. \"They're drugging us so we can be controlled,\" Zac (Fionn Whitehead, Dunkirk, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch) says when Christopher tells him about the toxin. They resolve to go off the Blue, and eventually most other crew members follow suit, bringing all those raging hormones to the fore. The result is teen rebellion against Alling's authority, growing distrust and paranoia, and of course, sexual experimentation and the desire for instant gratification. Could there be a mysterious alien life force lurking just outside the ship, further complicating matters? Ars Technica: I've seen this film described repeatedly as Lord of the Flies in space. Do you agree with that description? : It makes sense in a way. I love that book, and I love the Peter Brook movie. Whenever there are teenagers going wild or society breaking down, it becomes a Lord of the Flies reference. And I understand that. To me, it's a little different. Lord of the Flies is about those boys enacting male behavior from English society and [notions of] masculinity: hunting and going to war and all that stuff. This movie's a little different in the sense that this crewthey have no cultural reference. They have none of that background. Voyagers is about a group of extraordinary young people waking up to sensual desires, to freedom, to power, and the thrilling euphoria that goes with that experience. The ship is a sterile environment where the young crew almost seem like laboratory rats. We watch to see how they behave under the conditions, how quickly they descend into savagery. [The film] is more about, \"Who are we when you strip away all that cultural baggage? Who are we at our core? Are we good? Are we animals? Are we moral?\" Ars Technica: There are so many scientific elements in this film: designer babies, exoplanets, interstellar travel. You clearly did a lot of research on these and other story elements. What is your approach to weaving science into your storytelling? : I love science. I'm really interested in all sorts of aspects of it, and learning as much as I can about all sorts of things: growing babies in a laboratory, or how we're able to sense whether a distant planet has certain chemicals, if there's water on it. I love exploring all of that. I wanted to make [the film's setting] as real as possible. The themes about human nature are important and real, so I wanted the setting and the ship and everything around it to be as real as possible as well. The spacecraft is purely utilitarian and functional and based on actual proposals within NASA and other organizations studying space travel outside our solar system. Ars Technica: There's a nature versus nurture question, I think, that comes up because, as you say, these young people have no cultural context. They were genetically designed to be the ideal crew. But sometimes it's not enough to just design them that way, as we see with the character of Zac. There are other influences that shape who we are. : For me, the movie is about human nature in a vacuum. [The crew members] have no real models for behavior and little to do on the ship except eat, work, and sleep. In a way they are pure humansall nature, not nurture. I always thought of them as horses that have never been let out of the stall. As I said, when you strip away everything, who are we at our core? And is that even a real thing? Perhaps for the mission planners in this movie, that's what they were looking for. But there's always small things that do influence us. Is there something inside Zac, for example, that makes him tend toward a certain kind of response? I would argue that he's smart enough, that he senses that he's being controlled. So when he gets a little taste of his own control or power, he's just never going back. It [feels] reasonable, what he's doingeven though it isn't. Ars Technica: Zac's actions demonstrate the power of manipulating with misinformation. That resonates particularly strongly these days for obvious reasons. But it's fairly universal in human beings: even though we love our freedom, we are very vulnerable to that kind of manipulation. : I think we're understanding that more and more. When I wrote the screenplay, it was years ago, and I was obviously aware of that happening in our society and other societies. I was writing it as a cautionary tale. In the last few months, it's become something completely different. Fear is a big theme and a major issue in the movie: how a leader uses it to manipulate his followers and maybe even drive them to mob violence. It all raises questions about how a society can functionabout selfishness and self-sacrifice. That's the foundation of the conflict. Ars Technica: You've said that the ship is a metaphor for our world: humans hurtling through space on Earth, not sure why we're here or where we're going. And somehow we have to find meaning in that. We see the best and worst of human nature on display in the film as it builds up to a big central question: is humanity worth saving? : I think it is worth saving. And I think that we continue as a species to try to move things to a better place. It's tough and there are setbacks, but I think that the predominant thrust is to try to alleviate suffering in our fellow humans. It's not always easy. Voyagers is now playing in select theaters.

            "content": "The ongoing collaboration between Lego and NASA continues to delight. Back in 2017, the Danish toymaker brought out a highly detailed Saturn Va model ably assembled in time lapse by Ars' Eric Berger before its release. Two years later, Lego followed up with the Apollo 11 lunar lander, and in 2020 it was the turn of the International Space Station. And earlier this April, Lego released the latest set to bear NASA's famous worm logo: space shuttle Discovery, as it was for 1990's STS-31 mission. This was an important mission, reaching the highest orbit for a space shuttle to date. Discovery put the Hubble space telescope into orbit, and its crew even captured the event on IMAX cameras brought along for the ride. Lego has made a number of space shuttle sets over the years, but none has been as detailed as this 2,354-piece set. The finished orbiter is a substantial 21.8 inches (55.46 cm) long with a 13.6-inch (34.6 cm) wingspan, and it lends itself well to reproduction in Lego bricks at this scale; the space shuttle was covered in blocky tiles, after all. STS-31 was a mission to launch Hubble, and so it is with Hubble that you begin, a build that was reminiscent of the construction techniques used in the Saturn V. Over the past decade or so, Lego has adopted new building methods, sometimes known as SNOT (Studs Not On Top), that give designers much more freedom than vertically stacking bricks one atop another, and this set is a wonderful demonstration of that. Although the set is aimed at adultsthe box says 18+Discovery has a decent amount of playability. The undercarriage is spring-loaded, the elevons and rudder move, and it's solid enough to have decent swooshability. The mark of a good Lego build, to me at least, is when you build a step, then stop and exclaim \"that's so cool!\" as you understand the mechanism or construction you're putting together. I had at least five \"that's so cool!\" moments with Discovery, which should be taken as a ringing endorsement of this set. The only thing I'm not so effusive about is the price. At $199, it's nearly twice as expensive as the Saturn V, despite a brick count that isn't much higher. You must login or create an account to comment."

            "content": "Age of Empires games have always taken place against a historical backdrop, but Microsoft and Relic Entertainment want to take things even further with Age of Empires IV. The game will feature narrated documentaries throughout the campaigns, time period-accurate language and music, as well as art and game design that looks to take inspiration from both world history and the history of the Age of Empires franchise. On release, Age IV will focus on the Middle Ages, having players start with small agrarian villages and build up to castles and kings. While players can experience hundreds of years of history in a single match, the game will also feature campaigns that let players go through real-life stories that span generations. So far, the only one announced has been the Norman conquest starting with the Battle of Hastings. The campaigns in Age of Empires have always added some historical context to the battles and missions youll be doing, but in Age of Empires IV, each will be accompanied by documentary footage shot on location. The team behind the game says this is in celebration of history but also works to give players context around what theyre doing. Its easy to see how this could add to gameplay: skirmishes are fun, but knowing why you want to win a battle can really add to the drama of it all. We got to see some of the documentary footage in the Fan Preview event, and it looked like the type of thing that would fit in on Netflix or The History Channel, complete with narration, props, and actors in costume. During an interview, Emma Bridle, the director of customer voice for Age of Empires, told The Verge that she had grown up in England but learned things about British history from the campaign documentaries. (That is great to hear because, as an American, itll be even more of a learning experience because I know almost absolutely nothing about British history.) The team is also hoping to bring history to life through the audio: starting out, civilizations will be speaking in the ancient versions of their tongues. For example, if youre playing as the English, you probably wont be able to understand your units at the beginning of the game, as theyll be speaking a version of English thats unrecognizable to modern-day players. However, as you progress, youll start to understand more and more of what they say as the language evolves toward what we speak today. Similarly, the music starts as a stripped-down score with only a few instruments, evolving throughout the game to be a full orchestra as your civilization advances. In between talking about real-life history, the team also talked about the history of Age of Empires as a franchise and how Age IV will continue and evolve its legacy. To anyone whos played an AoE game, the art style will look instantly familiar but will have additional flourishes like the golden illuminated people that show the work being done on your buildings. The developers also talked about taking a look at the design of the old game to try to figure out what mechanics and behaviors were deliberate design decisions and which were due to technical limitations that could be tweaked and expanded upon. As someone who is a fan of Age of Empires but is generally ignorant about history, Im looking forward to being able to learn as I play. While previous games in the franchise did have historical dressing, I cant say they taught me much. Perhaps that will change with Age IV. But it seems that the game wants to present plenty of historical context during every game mode, both about ancient civilizations and not-so-ancient games.

            "content": "China has hit Alibaba, one of the countrys biggest online retailers, with a record $2.8 billion (18.2 billion yuan) fine, after an investigation found the ecommerce giant violated Chinas anti-monopoly law, The New York Times reported. The fine, which represents 4 percent of Alibabas 2019 domestic sales, is three times higher than the $975 billion fine China imposed on US chip company Qualcomm back in 2015. The Chinese government launched an investigation into Alibaba in December to determine whether the company was preventing merchants from selling their products on other platforms. Chinas market regulator found that Alibabas practices had a negative effect on online retail competition and innovation. Alibaba used data and algorithms to strengthen its own position in the marketplace, resulting in an improper competitive advantage, Chinas State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement. The company will have to reduce its anticompetitive tactics and provide compliance reports to the government for the next three years. Alibaba said in a statement it accepted the fine and pledged to make improvements to better serve its responsibility to society. We will further strengthen our focus on customer value creation and customer experience, as well as continuing to introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs of operating on our platforms, the companys statement reads. We are committed to ensuring an operating environment for our merchants and partners that is more open, more equitable, more efficient and more inclusive in sharing the fruits of growth. The hefty fine is not likely to hurt Alibabas bottom line too severely, however; in February, the company reported a third quarter profit  for the final three months of calendar year 2020 alone of $12 billion.

            "content": "Negative sentiment regarding our company is often transferred to Mr. Zuckerberg A new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Facebook spent more than $23 million last year on security for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Facebooks annual reviews of company security identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg, according to a proxy statement filed Friday. He is synonymous with Facebook, and as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg, the proxy says of the Facebook CEOs role. The companys annual review of security programs showed the costs of protecting Zuckerberg and his family rose in 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 travel protocols, increased security coverage during the 2020 US election season and other periods with increased security risk, as well as rising costs for security personnel. The all other compensation section of the proxy statement shows Facebook spent $23 million for personal security at Zuckerbergs residences and for travel for him and his family. The CEO also got an additional $10 million to put toward security personnel and other security costs. The cost of base security was up to $13.4 million last year, compared to $10.4 million the year prior. The compensation, nominating & governance committee believes that these costs are appropriate and necessary in light of the threat landscape and the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg has requested to receive only $1 in annual salary and does not receive any bonus payments, equity awards, or other incentive compensation, according to the proxy statement. Also in the proxy filed Friday, Facebook said it will put forward a proposal at its May 26th shareholder meeting to offer personal security to non-employee directors from time to time, which it says is necessary due to ongoing scrutiny faced by our directors as a result of their service on our board of directors. Facebook approved personal security services for some of the non-employee directors in January and February in light of the high level of scrutiny faced by our company and our executive officers and directors, as well as the dynamic and charged atmosphere following the 2020 U.S. elections and the attack on the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021, according to the proxy statement. A January report by the Tech Transparency Project found that some extremists rioters at the Capitol attack had used private groups on Facebook for months to plan and coordinate the January 6th insurgency, despite remarks by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg that the events were largely organized on platforms that dont have our ability to stop hate, dont have our standards and dont have our transparency.

AG Letitia James lawsuit alleges that the ecommerce giant failed to protect workers at its Brooklyn and Staten Island warehouses from COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic, and retaliated against employees who complained about the lack of safety measures. Amazon had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that workplace safety issues were not under James purview. The company pre-emptively sued James on February 12th, and James sued Amazon four days later. Amazon then moved the lawsuit to federal court. Amazon has forced its employees to work in unsafe conditions throughout this pandemic, James said in a statement following US District Judge Jed Rakoffs order. We are pleased with todays decision to allow this case to be heard in state court, where it belongs. The ruling did not address the merits of the lawsuit, which seeks improved conditions for workers and damages for two Amazon workers who say the company retaliated against them. Workers at Amazons JKF8 warehouse in Staten Island said last March that they didnt have necessary protective equipment. Amazon fired several workers who protested the conditions, including Chris Smalls, who had organized a walkout. At the time, James called Smalls firing disgraceful and pushed for an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. Amazon said at the time that the workers were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions but for violating safety policies.

NASA engineers have decided to delay the Ingenuity helicopters debut flight on Mars to at least Wednesday, April 14th, after running into a minor computer glitch during a rotor spin test late Friday night, the agency said on Saturday. The tiny craft is healthy, but engineers need some more time to review telemetry data from the unexpected hiccup before proceeding. Ingenuity, a mini four-pound helicopter that arrived on Mars February 18th attached to NASAs Perseverance rover, was initially slated to carry out its first flight test late Sunday night (or, mid-day Mars time). The first bits of data on whether the flight attempt was successful was expected to come early Monday morning, around 4AM ET. But data from a high-speed rotor test carried out on Friday showed the test sequence ended early due to a watchdog timer expiration, NASA said. It happened as Ingenuitys computer was trying to switch from pre-flight mode to flight mode. Ingenuitys watchdog timer is just that  a software-based watchdog that oversees the helicopters test sequences and alerts engineers if anything looks abnormal. It helps the system stay safe by not proceeding if an issue is observed and worked as planned, NASA said in a blog post. NASA emphasized the craft is healthy, and Ingenuity is still in good contact with engineers at the agencys Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Ingenuity was deployed by Perseverance on the Martian surface on April 4th, kicking off a 31-day clock in which five flight tests are planned. For its first flight demonstration, the helicopter will ascend 10 feet above the surface and hover for about 30 seconds, aiming to achieve the first-ever powered flight on another world. Depending how the first test goes, subsequent tests will involve Ingenuity soaring to higher altitudes and buzzing around within its running track-shaped flight zone at Mars Jezero Crater.

The agency has delayed Ingenuity's first flight to \"no earlier than\" April 14th after a test on April 9th went awry. The high-speed spin test finished prematurely after a watchdog timer (meant to catch technical issues) expired while transitioning the helicopter to its flight mode. NASA stressed that Ingenuity was \"safe and healthy,\" and that it was reviewing telemetry from the vehicle to both understand what happened and determine when the first flight might occur. The initial flight was originally slated for late on April 11th. If the plan moves forward, the flight will be a 30-second hover at 10 feet. Four more flights are in the pipeline over a total span of 30 days. This clearly isn't what NASA wanted. The mission team has every incentive to be cautious, however. This test will represent the first time a vehicle has flown on the Martian surface  a success here will pave the way for future flying explorers."

The Verge reports that the Biden White House has issued its first budget proposal, and the plan would spend $150 million to establish two Manufacturing Innovation Institute programs that include one for domestic chip production. The relevant institute would help the US reclaim its title as a \"global leader\" in semiconductor manufacturing, according to the tentative budget. The proposal doesn't outline just how the institute would accomplish its goals, or which companies might get support. Intel and Samsung are two of the best-known companies with US-based chip plants, while TSMC will start building an Arizona factory this year. The funds would be just a small part of a larger $1.5 trillion package that would also support clean energy projects, expand rural broadband access and spur adoption of electric vehicles in government. There's no certainty the manufacturing push will work. The institute doesn't amount to a direct investment, and its success will depend on its exact approach. However, it reflects mounting concerns that a lack of US-based production is hurting the country. Ford, GM, Apple and other brands are either known or rumored to be grappling with manufacturing issues related to chip shortfalls. If the budget moves forward, it could help ease that strain and help the US reduce the chances of a future crisis."

As Variety reports, the FBI has arrested Texas resident Seth Aaron Pendley over a charge that he planned to blow up an Amazon Web Services data center in Virginia. Pendley allegedly revealed to an undercover agent that he planned to use plastic explosives to take down data centers in a bid to \"kill\" most of the internet and the federal institutions that he believed were part of the \"oligarchy\" in the US. The Justice Department characterized Pendley as a domestic extremist. He claimed to have been present at the Capitol riot on January 6th, and the FBI first caught word of his plans soon afterward after a tipster warned of \"alarming statements\" he made on a pro-militia web forum. The accused man reportedly expected people to die in the attacks. Pendley could serve up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Amazon said in a statement that it took data center security \"incredibly seriously.\" This comes while Parler is suing Amazon for dumping the social network from AWS, although it's not clear the two are related. The supposed plot highlights the internet's dependence on AWS and the possible consequences if an attack is successful. As many have discovered, problems at Amazon data centers can cause outages for a host of services, including tech giants like Adobe. Pendley's attack would have disrupted the internet for many people, not just federal agencies. This also suggests that physical security may be increasingly important for data centers now that terrorists see them as possible targets."

            "content": "In the last few weeks, weve been keeping ourselves busy with plenty of new videos and guides  and of course, a bunch of product reviews Chris Velazco spent some time trying out all the new features on OnePlus pricey new handset, the 9 Pro, while Billy Steele reviewed Master & Dynamics new MW08 earbuds. Cherlynn Low brought the new Nest Hub to her bedside to try out its new sleep tracking capabilities, and Nathan Ingraham stress-tested the new Sonos Roam speaker by throwing it across the room and dunking it in a bucket of water. I also tested several different baby monitors to find the best ones for your nursery, and Billy found the best wireless headphones for audio enthusiasts and casual listeners alike. Unlike the Sonos Move, the new Roam speaker is much easier to take with you wherever you go. Nathan Ingraham found the $170 speaker incredibly portable due to its size  it measures just over six and a half inches tall and weighs less than a pound. He tested the Roams water-resistance and toughness by dropping it in a bucket of water and throwing it across the room. It kept playing through it all. Nathan said that despite its tiny size, the Roam still sounds great without any distortion or getting overly boomy at high volumes. The speaker includes a tweeter and a mid-woofer instead of just a single driver, and that setup helps produce clear highs and mids as well as a satisfying bass thump throughout the volume range. He also found the 10-hour battery estimate right on target. Though he thought that two speakers playing in stereo provided a wide soundstage in a living room, he maintained that the Roam wouldnt likely be loud enough for outdoor parties. Chris Velazco has seen each smartphone from OnePlus get better, faster and more expensive. The companys popular line-up now includes the OnePlus 9 Pro, a flagship smartphone that starts at $970. Featuring a 6.7-inch, 3,216 x 1,440 AMOLED display with 1,300 nits of brightness, the 9 Pro has one of the nicest screens Chris has seen on a handset and it worked well even in bright sunlight. With running on a Snapdragon 888 processor and with a variable refresh rate, Chris said there was very little it couldnt handle, including playing Fortnite. But thats not the most remarkable upgrade the 9 Pro has to offer; Chris said the combination of the companys partnership with Hasselblad and better sensors has made for a significantly improved camera experience. Chris said his photos were gorgeous and the Hasselblad contribution made for colors that were true to life. However, that all contributes to making the 9 Pro more expensive than ever, which might irritate OnePlus fans. Chris also counted the limited carrier support for 5G and a meh telephoto camera among the handsets drawbacks. Billy Steele has watched Master & Dynamic work through three iterations of true wireless earbuds to produce the MW08, which he calls the companys best yet. The MW08 model keeps the same D-shaped design, but theyre smaller and dont have much hardware sitting outside your ears. While a net positive, this also means the onboard controls are smaller as well, which Billy found cumbersome. Fortunately, the signature sound profile still impressed: Billy said the details were clear and crisp with a natural sounding tuning. The addition of 11mm beryllium-coated drivers helped produce a sound profile that Billy called the best hes encountered on a set of true wireless earbuds. The MW08 also have improved active noise cancelling (ANC) with two options: Max ANC and All Day ANC. These modes can be switched via the M&D Connect app, which is a new release from the company. M&D Connect also allows users to change ambient sound modes (of which there are two), adjust the auto-off timer and disable in-ear detection. But it doesnt have a customizable EQ or any sound presets, nor does Master & Dynamic plan to add those features in the future. While the 12-hour battery life pleased Billy, he noted that the earbuds dont feature any wireless charging. The signature feature of the new $100 Nest Hub is a built-in radar sensor that detects motion to track the length and quality of your sleep. It can also sense your snoring and coughing and tell how bright or warm your room is. But Cherlynn Low found it isnt everything its cracked up to be. It has to be positioned near your head, at the same height as the mattress (which isnt always convenient), and it requires at least an initial week of tracking before it can start to produce results on its Wellness panel. Though she says its impressive as a proof of concept, the data it collected as she slept didnt turn out to be terribly insightful. However, she was much more impressed by its capabilities as a smart display. At $100, its cheaper than the original model but the Google Assistant is faster, the audio was louder and clearer and it now offers dashboards and interfaces for smart home controls. The new Nest Hub can make Duo calls, play YouTube videos and search for recipes, too. She also liked that the Soli sensor could also be used for motion controls  for example, swiping your hand in the air to dismiss a timer alarm. Overall, Cherlynn says she would recommend it if youre looking for a solid smart display, but dont count on it being the best sleep tracking solution."

            "content": "I'm not sure why people are worried about AI surpassing humanity's collective intellect any time soon, we can't even get the systems we have today to quit emulating some of our more ignoble tendencies. Or rather, perhaps we humans must first detangle ourselves from these very same biases before expecting them eliminated from our algorithms. In A Citizen's Guide to Artificial Intelligence, John Zerilli leads a host of prominent researchers and authors in the field of AI and machine learning to present readers with an approachable, holistic examination of both the history and current state of the art, the potential benefits of and challenges facing ever-improving AI technology, and how this rapidly advancing field could influence society for decades to come. Excerpted from A Citizen's Guide to AI Copyright  2021 By John Zerilli with John Danaher, James Maclaurin, Colin Gavaghan, Alistair Knott, Joy Liddicoat and Merel Noorman. Used with permission of the publisher, MIT Press. Human bias is a mix of hardwired and learned biases, some of which are sensible (such as you should wash your hands before eating), and others of which are plainly false (such as atheists have no morals). Artificial intelligence likewise suffers from both built-in and learned biases, but the mechanisms that produce AIs built-in biases are different from the evolutionary ones that produce the psychological heuristics and biases of human reasoners. One group of mechanisms stems from decisions about how practical problems are to be solved in AI. These decisions often incorporate programmers sometimes-biased expectations about how the world works. Imagine youve been tasked with designing a machine learning system for landlords who want to find good tenants. Its a perfectly sensible question to ask, but where should you go looking for the data that will answer it? There are many variables you might choose to use in training your system  age, income, sex, current postcode, high school attended, solvency, character, alcohol consumption? Leaving aside variables that are often misreported (like alcohol consumption) or legally prohibited as discriminatory grounds of reasoning (like sex or age), the choices you make are likely to depend at least to some degree on your own beliefs about which things influence the behavior of tenants. Such beliefs will produce bias in the algorithms output, particularly if developers omit variables which are actually predictive of being a good tenant, and so harm individuals who would otherwise make good tenants but wont be identified as such. The same problem will appear again when decisions have to be made about the way data is to be collected and labeled. These decisions often wont be visible to the people using the algorithms. Some of the information will be deemed commercially sensitive. Some will just be forgotten. The failure to document potential sources of bias can be particularly problematic when an AI designed for one purpose gets co-opted in the service of another  as when a credit score is used to assess someones suitability as an employee. The danger inherent in adapting AI from one context to another has recently been dubbed the portability trap. Its a trap because it has the potential to degrade both the accuracy and fairness of the repurposed algorithms. Consider also a system like TurnItIn. Its one of many anti-plagiarism systems used by universities. Its makers say that it trawls 9.5 billion web pages (including common research sources such as online course notes and reference works like Wikipedia). It also maintains a database of essays previously submitted through TurnItIn that, according to its marketing material, grows by more than fifty thousand essays per day. Student-submitted essays are then compared with this information to detect plagiarism. Of course, there will always be some similarities if a students work is compared to the essays of large numbers of other students writing on common academic topics. To get around this problem, its makers chose to compare relatively long strings of characters. Lucas Introna, a professor of organization, technology and ethics at Lancaster University, claims that TurnItIn is biased. TurnItIn is designed to detect copying but all essays contain something like copying. Paraphrasing is the process of putting other peoples ideas into your own words, demonstrating to the marker that you understand the ideas in question. It turns out that theres a difference in the paraphrasing of native and nonnative speakers of a language. People learning a new language write using familiar and sometimes lengthy fragments of text to ensure theyre getting the vocabulary and structure of expressions correct. This means that the paraphrasing of nonnative speakers of a language will often contain longer fragments of the original. Both groups are paraphrasing, not cheating, but the nonnative speakers get persistently higher plagiarism scores. So a system designed in part to minimize biases from professors unconsciously influenced by gender and ethnicity seems to inadvertently produce a new form of bias because of the way it handles data. Theres also a long history of built-in biases deliberately designed for commercial gain. One of the greatest successes in the history of AI is the development of recommender systems that can quickly and efficiently find consumers the cheapest hotel, the most direct flight, or the books and music that best suit their tastes. The design of these algorithms has become extremely important to merchants  and not just online merchants. If the design of such a system meant your restaurant never came up in a search, your business would definitely take a hit. The problem gets worse the more recommender systems become entrenched and effectively compulsory in certain industries. It can set up a dangerous conflict of interest if the same company that owns the recommender system also owns some of the products or services its recommending. This problem was first documented in the 1960s after the launch of the SABRE airline reservation and scheduling system jointly developed by IBM and American Airlines. It was a huge advance over call center operators armed with seating charts and drawing pins, but it soon became apparent that users wanted a system that could compare the services offered by a range of airlines. A descendent of the resulting recommender engine is still in use, driving services such as Expedia and Travelocity. It wasnt lost on American Airlines that their new system was, in effect, advertising the wares of their competitors. So they set about investigating ways in which search results could be presented so that users would more often select American Airlines. So although the system would be driven by information from many airlines, it would systematically bias the purchasing habits of users toward American Airlines. Staff called this strategy screen science. American Airlines screen science didnt go unnoticed. Travel agents soon spotted that SABREs top recommendation was often worse than those further down the page. Eventually the president of American Airlines, Robert L. Crandall, was called to testify before Congress. Astonishingly, Crandall was completely unrepentant, testifying that the preferential display of our flights, and the corresponding increase in our market share, is the competitive raison detre for having created the [SABRE] system in the first place. Crandalls justification has been christened Crandalls complaint, namely, Why would you build and operate an expensive algorithm if you cant bias it in your favor? Looking back, Crandalls complaint seems rather quaint. There are many ways recommender engines can be monetized. They dont need to produce biased results in order to be financially viable. That said, screen science hasnt gone away. There continue to be allegations that recommender engines are biased toward the products of their makers. Ben Edelman collated all the studies in which Google was found to promote its own products via prominent placements in such results. These include Google Blog Search, Google Book Search, Google Flight Search, Google Health, Google Hotel Finder, Google Images, Google Maps, Google News, Google Places, Google+, Google Scholar, Google Shopping, and Google Video. Deliberate bias doesnt only influence what you are offered by recommender engines. It can also influence what youre charged for the services recommended to you. Search personalization has made it easier for companies to engage in dynamic pricing. In 2012, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that the recommender system employed by a travel company called Orbiz appeared to be recommending more expensive accommodation to Mac users than to Windows users."
